<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>REACHING INTO TO-MORROW.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>FROM the back parlor there came the
sound of fresh young voices brimming
with energy. Several voices at once, indeed,
after the fashion of eager young ladies well
acquainted with one another, and having
important schemes to further. Occasionally
there were bursts of laughter, indicating that
freedom of speech and good fellowship reigned
among the workers.</div>

<p>The committee, or the society, or the association,
whatever it was, was breaking up,
for the door was ajar, one young lady standing
near it, her hand out as if to open it
wider, preparatory to departure, while she
waited to say another of the many last things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Others were drawing wraps about them, or
donning furs and overshoes, and talking as
they worked. Their voices, clear and brisk,
sounded distinctly down the long hall.</p>

<p>"And about the Committee on Award;
you will attend to that, Claire, will you
not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, and what are we to do about Mrs.
Stuart?"</p>

<p>"Why, Claire promised to see her. She
is just the one to do it. Mrs. Stuart will
do anything for her."</p>

<p>"And, Claire, you must be sure to see the
Snyders before the judge starts on his Southern
trip! If we don't get his positive promise,
we may have trouble."</p>

<p>"Claire Benedict, you promised to help me
with my Turkish costume, you know. I
haven't the least idea how to get it up."</p>

<p>Then a younger voice:</p>

<p>"Miss Claire, you will drill me on my
recitation, won't you? Mamma says you are
just the one to show me how."</p>

<p>"And, oh! Claire, don't forget to see that
ponderous Doctor Wheelock and get his subscription.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
It frightens me to think of going
to him."</p>

<p>In the sitting-room opposite stood Claire's
younger sister, Dora Benedict. She had just
come in from the outer world, and with part
of her wraps still gathered about her, stood
watching the falling snow, and listening to
the voices in the back parlor. At this point
she spoke:</p>

<p>"Mamma, just hear the girls! They are
heaping up the work on Claire, giving her
the planning and the collecting and the drilling,
and the greater portion of the programme
to attend to, and she calmly agrees to do
it all."</p>

<p>"Your sister has a great amount of executive
ability, my dear, and is always to be
depended on. Such people are sure to have
plenty of burdens to carry."</p>

<p>Mrs. Benedict said this in a gently modulated,
satisfied voice, and leaned back in her
easy chair and smiled as she spoke. She
delayed a stitch in her crimson tidy, while
she listened a moment to the sound of Claire's
voice, calmly and assuringly shouldering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
burdens of work; promising here, offering
there, until the listeners in the sitting-room
were prepared to sympathize with the words
spoken in the parlor in a relieved tone of
voice:</p>

<p>"I declare, Claire Benedict, you are a host
in yourself! What we should do without you
is more than I can imagine."</p>

<p>"I should think as much!" This from the
girl in the brown-plumed hat, who listened
in the next room. "You couldn't do without
her! that is just all there would be
about it! Two thirds of your nice plans,
for which you get so much credit, would fall
through. Mamma, do you think Claire ought
to attempt so much?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," responded the gentle-faced
woman thus appealed to, pausing
again in her fancy work to consider the
question. "Claire has remarkable talent, you
know, in all these directions. She is a born
organizer and leader, and the girls are willing
to follow her lead. I don't know but
she works too hard. It is difficult to avoid
that, with so many people depending on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I don't myself see how they would manage
without her. You know Doctor Ellis feels
much the same. He was telling your father,
only last night, that there was not another
young lady in the church on whom he could
depend as he did on her. Your father was
amused at his earnestness. He said he should
almost feel like giving up his pastorate here,
if he should lose her. Claire is certainly a
power in the church, and the society generally.
I should feel sorry for them if they
were to lose her."</p>

<p>The mother spoke this sentence quietly,
with the unruffled look of peace and satisfaction
on her face. No foreboding of loss
came to her. She thought, it is true, of the
barely possible time when her eldest daughter
might go out from this home into some
other, and have other cares and responsibilities,
but the day seemed very remote. Claire
was young, and was absorbed in her church
and home work.</p>

<p>Apparently, even the <i>suggestion</i> of another
home had not come to her. It might never
come. She might live always in the dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
home nest, sheltered, and sheltering, in her
turn, others less favored. Or in the event
of a change, some time in the future, it
might be, possibly, just from one street in
the same city to another, and much of the
old life go on still; and in any event the
mother could say "their loss," not mine;
for the sense of possible separation had not
come near enough to shadow the mother's
heart as yet; she lived in the dreamland of
belief that a married daughter would be as
near to the mother and the home as an
unmarried one. Therefore her face was placid,
and she sewed her crimson threads and talked
placidly of what might have been, but was
not; the future looked secure and smiling.</p>

<p>"You see," she continued to the young
and but half-satisfied daughter, "it is an
unusual combination of things that makes
your sister so important to this society.
There are not many girls in it who have
wealth and leisure, and the peculiar talents
required for leadership. Run over the list in
your mind, and you will notice that those
who have plenty of time would not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
what to do with it unless Claire were here
to tell them, and those who have plenty of
money would fritter it all away, without her
to guide, and set a grand example for
them."</p>

<p>"I am not questioning her ability, mamma,"
the daughter said, with a little laugh, "that is,
her mental ability; but it seems to me they
ought to remember that she has a body, as
well as the others. Still, she will always
work at something, I suppose; she is made
in that mold. Mamma, what do you suppose
Claire would do if she were poor?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea, daughter. I
hope she would do the best she could; but
I think I feel grateful that there seems
little probability of our discovering by experience."</p>

<p>"Still, one can never tell what may happen."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, that is true; I was speaking of
probabilities."</p>

<p>Still the mother's face was placid. She
called them probabilities, but when she thought
of her husband's wealth and position in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
mercantile world, they really seemed to her
very much like certainties.</p>

<p>And now the little coterie in the back
parlor broke up in earnest, and, exclaiming
over the lateness of the hour, made haste
into the snowy world outside.</p>

<p>Claire followed the last one to the door;
a young and pretty girl, afraid of her own
decided capabilities, unless kissed and petted
by this stronger spirit into using them.</p>

<p>"You will be sure to do well, Alice dear,
and remember I depend on you."</p>

<p>This was the last drop of dew for the
frightened young flower, and it brightened
visibly under it, and murmured:</p>

<p>"I will do my best; I don't want to disappoint
you."</p>

<p>Then Claire came into the sitting-room,
and dropped with an air of satisfied weariness
into one of the luxurious chairs, and
folded her hands to rest.</p>

<p>"Dora thinks you are carrying too much
on your shoulders, dear." This from the
fancy worker.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mamma, my shoulders are strong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Everything is in fine train. I think our girls
are really getting interested in missions now,
as well as in having a good time, that is
what I am after, you know, but some of
them don't suspect it. Why didn't you come
to the committee meeting, Dora?"</p>

<p>"I have but just come in from Strausser's,
on that commission, you know, and I thought
if I appeared, there would be so many questions
to answer, and so much to explain,
that the girls would not get away to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you see Mr. Strausser? Well,
what did he say?" And Claire sat erect,
her weariness gone, and gave herself to work
again.</p>

<p>The door bell rang, and she was presently
summoned to the hall.</p>

<p>"One of your poor persons," was the servant's
message.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a long story to tell,
and Claire listened, and questioned, and
commented, and rang the bell to give directions
for a certain package from a certain
closet to be brought, and sent Dora to
her room for her pocket-book, and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the "poor person" went away, her voice
sounding cheered and grateful as she said
inquiringly:</p>

<p>"Then you will be sure to come over to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Dora laughed, as Claire returned to the
easy chair.</p>

<p>"How many things you are going to do
to-morrow, Claire? I heard you promise the
girls a dozen or so. And that reminds me
that Doctor Ellis wants to know if you
will look in to-morrow, and go with Mrs.
Ellis to call on a new family, of whom he
said he told you."</p>

<p>"I know," said Claire, "I was thinking
about them this morning. I must try and
go to-morrow. They are people who ought
not to be neglected. Did he say at what
hour? Oh, mamma, have you that broth
ready for aunt Kate? I might go around
there with it now: I shall not have time
to-morrow, and I promised her I would come
myself before the week closed."</p>

<p>Then the fast falling snow was discussed,
and demurred over a little by mother and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
younger sister, and laughingly accepted by
Claire as a pleasant accessory to a winter
walk; and it ended, as things were apt to
end in that family, in Claire having her
own way, and sallying forth equipped for
the storm, with her basket of comforts on
her arm.</p>

<p>She looked back to Dora to say that
mamma must not worry if she were detained,
for she had promised to look in at Mr.
Anstead's and make some arrangements for
to-morrow's committee meeting; and to add
that the papers in the library were to be
left as they were, ready for to-morrow.</p>

<p>"It is the eventful day," she said, laughingly,
"our work is to culminate then. We
are to discover what the fruit of all this
getting ready is; we are to have things
just as they are to be, without a break or
a pause."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Dora.</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'perhaps,' you naughty
croaker? Do you dare to think that anything
will be less than perfect after the
weeks of labor we have given it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can I tell? Nothing is ever perfect.
Did you never notice, Claire, that it is
impossible to get through a single day just
as one plans it?"</p>

<p>"I have noticed it," Claire answered, smiling,
"but I did not know that your young
head had taken it in."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I have. <i>I</i> plan occasionally,
myself, but I am like Paul in one thing,
any way, 'how to perform I find not.' It
is worse on Saturday than any other day.
I almost never do as I intended."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't quote Bible verses with a
twisted meaning, if I were you, little girl.
It is a dangerous habit; I know by experience.
They so perfectly fit into life,
that one is sorely tempted. But I am not
often troubled in the way you mention;
my plans generally come out all right.
Possibly because I have studied them from
several sides, and foreseen and provided for
hindrances. There is a great deal in that.
You see, to-morrow, if I don't get through
with all the engagements laid out for it. I
have studied them all, and there really <i>can't</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
anything happen to throw me very far off
my programme."</p>

<p>There was an air of complacency about
the speaker, and a satisfied smile on her
face as she tripped briskly away. She was a
skilful and successful general. Was there
any harm in her realizing it?</p>

<p>Dora went back to the gentle mother.</p>

<p>"The house will be alive all day to-morrow,
mamma. Claire has half a dozen committee
meetings here at different hours, and
a great rehearsal of all their exercises for
the literary entertainment. There will be no
place for quiet, well-behaved people like you
and me. What do you suppose is the matter
with me? I feel like a croaker. If
Claire had not just scolded me for quoting
the Bible to suit my moods, I should have
said to her, 'Boast not thyself of to-morrow,
for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Benedict looked up searchingly into
the face of her young daughter, who was
so unlike her sister, who took life doubtfully,
and bristled with interrogation points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>,
and dreamed while the other worked, and
leaned on Claire everywhere and always,
even as she knew she did herself.</p>

<p>"Claire isn't boastful, dear, I think," she
said gently. "It is right for her to rest
in the brightness of the present and to trust
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, she has planned to-morrow, mamma;
there is nothing to trust about."</p>

<p>Then after a moment:</p>

<p>"Mamma, she is good and splendid, just
as she always is, and I am cross."</p>

<p>Whereupon she sprang to meet her father,
and before he had divested himself of his
snowy great-coat, she had covered his bearded
face with kisses and dropped some tears on
his hands.</p>

<p>It was after family worship that evening,
when the father stood with a daughter on
either side of him, with an arm around each,
that he rallied Dora on her tearful greeting.</p>

<p>"Dora is mercurial," her mother said.
"Her birthday comes in April, and there is
very apt to be a shower right in the midst
of sunshine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"She has studied too hard to-day," the
father said, kissing her fondly. "After a
good night's rest, the sunshine will get the
better of the showers."</p>

<p>"They both need developing in exactly
different ways," he said to the mother when
they were left to themselves.</p>

<p>He looked after his two beautiful girls
fondly as he spoke, but the last words they
had heard from him were:</p>

<p>"Good-night, daughters! Get ready for a
bright to-morrow. The storm is about over."</p>

<p>"The storm did not trouble me," said
Claire. "Real work often gets on better in
a storm; and I think we shall have a
chance to try it. I think papa is mistaken;
the sky says to me that we shall have a
stormy day."</p>

<p>When "to-morrow" came, the sun shone
brilliantly in a cloudless sky; but every
shutter in the Benedict mansion was closed,
and crape streamed from the doorknobs;
and during all that memorable day neither
daughter did one thing that had been planned
for the day before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>WHY?</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>JUST at midnight&mdash;that is, just at the
dawning of the "to-morrow" for which
so much had been planned&mdash;Claire was
awakened by a quick, decisive knock at her
door, followed by a voice which expressed
haste and terror:</div>

<p>"Miss Claire, your mother wants you to
come right away, and bring Miss Dora.
Your father is sick."</p>

<p>And Claire was alert in an instant, wakening,
soothing and helping the frightened
Dora. She herself was not greatly alarmed.
It is true, her father was not subject to
sudden illnesses; but then, men were often
sick, and very sick, too, while the attack
lasted. She called to mind the story Nettie
Stuart had told her that afternoon, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
"papa was so ill the night before that they
really thought he would die, and everybody
in the house was up waiting on him." Yet
"papa" had been at the bank that next day,
looking nearly as well as usual. Had it
been her frail mother who was ill, Claire
felt that her pulses would have quickened
more than they did now. Mamma did not
seem strong enough to bear much pain, but
papa was a man of iron frame, everybody
said.</p>

<p>She told over some of these encouraging
thoughts to Dora, while she helped her to
dress:</p>

<p>"Don't tremble so, darling; there is nothing
to be frightened about. Papa has one
of his dreadful headaches, I presume, and
mamma needs us to help care for him. You
know she is not feeling so well as usual. She
promised to call me the next time papa
needed nursing. Men are so unused to suffering,
that a pain is something terrible to
them while it lasts."</p>

<p>They sped down the stairs together, Claire
having slackened none of her speed because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
she believed there was no cause for alarm.
Her hand was on her mother's doorknob,
when the door swung open, and the mother's
white face made her start back in affright.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" she said, in a strange,
agonized voice, groping about with her hand
as though she did not see distinctly, though
the hall was brightly lighted. "O, children,
children, you are too late! Oh, why"&mdash;and
she fell senseless at their feet; and Claire
was bending over her, lifting her in trembling
arms, trying to speak soothing words,
all the time wondering in a terror-stricken
way what all this could mean! Too late for
what?</p>

<p>They had to settle down to inevitable
facts, as so many poor souls before, and
since, have had to do. Of course, the first
wildness of grief passed, and they realized
but too well that the father who had kissed
them and bade them look out for a bright
to-morrow, had gone away, and taken all
the brightness of the to-morrow with him.
At first they could not believe it possible.
Father dead! Why, his robust frame and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
splendid physique had been the remark of
guests ever since they could remember!
He had been fond of boasting that a physician
had not been called for him in twenty
years.</p>

<p>Well, the physician arrived too late on this
particular night, when he had been called;
another call had been louder, and the father
went to answer to it. Well for him that he
had long before made ready for this journey,
and that there was nothing in the summons
that would have alarmed him, had he been
given time to have realized it.</p>

<p>The poor widow went over, again and
again, the details of that awful hour:</p>

<p>"We had a little talk together, just as
usual. Much of it was about you; that was
natural, too; he talked a great deal about
you, children; and on that evening, he said,
after you left the room, that you both needed
developing in different ways, and sometimes
it troubled him to know how it was to be
done. I did not understand him, and I
asked what he meant. He said some things
that I will try to tell you when my head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
is clearer. He was very earnest about it,
and asked me to kneel down with him, and
he prayed again for you, dear girls, and
for me, a wonderful prayer. It wasn't like
any that I ever heard before. Oh, I might
have known then that it was to prepare
me; but I didn't think of such a thing. I
asked him if he felt well, and he said, oh,
yes, only more tired than usual; it had
been a hard day, and there were business
matters that were not so smooth as he could
wish. But he told me there was nothing to
worry about; only affairs that would require
careful handling, such as he meant to give
them. Then he dropped to sleep, and I lay
awake a little, thinking over what he had
said about you two, and wondering if he
was right in his conclusions. At last I slept,
too, and I knew nothing more until his heavy
breathing awakened me.</p>

<p>"I made all possible haste for lights, and
sent for the doctor and for you just as soon
as I could get an answer to the bell; and
Thomas was quick, too, but it seemed an
age. The moment I had a glimpse of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
father's face, I knew something dreadful was
the matter; but I did not think, even then,
that he was going to leave me."</p>

<p>At this point the desolate wife would
break into a storm of tears, and the daughters
would give themselves to soothing words
and tender kisses, and put aside as best
they could the consuming desire to know
what that dear father's last thoughts had
been for them.</p>

<p>Well, the days passed. Isn't it curious
how time moves along steadily, after the
object for which we think time was made
has slipped away?</p>

<p>This sudden death, however, had made an
unusual break in the usual order of things.
Mr. Benedict's name was too closely identified
with all the business interests of the
city, as well as with its moral and religious
interests, not to have his departure from
their midst make great differences, and be
widely felt.</p>

<p>The few days following his death were
days of general and spontaneous public
demonstration. On the afternoon of the funeral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
great warehouses were closed, because
his name was identified with them; stores
were closed, because crape waved from the
doors of his, the largest in the line. The
First National Bank was closed, for he was
one of the Directors. The public schools
were closed, because he had been prominent
among their Board of Directors; and it was
so that on every street some token of the
power of the great man gone was shown.</p>

<p>As for the church, and the Sabbath-school,
and the prayer-room, they were draped in
mourning; but that feebly expressed the
sense of loss.</p>

<p>"We cannot close our doors to show our
sorrow," said Doctor Ellis, his lips tremulous;
"we have need to throw them more widely
open, and rally with renewed effort, for one
of the mighty is fallen."</p>

<p>To the widow and her girls, there was,
as the hours passed, a sort of sad pleasure
in noting this universal mourning; in listening
to the tearful words expressing a sense
of personal loss, which came right from the
hearts of so many men and women and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
children. They began to see that they had
not half realized his power in the community,
as young men in plain, sometimes rough
dress, men whose names they had never
heard, and whose faces they had never seen,
came and stood over the coffin, and dropped
great tears as they told in the brief and
subdued language of the heart, of some lift,
or word, or touch of kindness, that this man
had given them, just when they needed it most.</p>

<p>Born of these tender and grateful tributes
from all classes, was a drop of bitterness
that seemed to spread as Claire turned it
over in her troubled heart. It could all be
suggested to those familiar with the intricacies
of the human heart, by that one little
word, Why? It sometimes becomes an awful
word, with power to torture the torn heart
almost to madness. "Why was father, a
man so good, so true, so grand, so sadly
needed in this wicked world, snatched from
it just in the prime of his power?" She
brooded over this in silence and in secret&mdash;not
wishing to burden her mother's heart
by the query, not liking to add a suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of bitterness to Dora's sorrowful cup.
Only once, when a fresh exhibition of his
care for others, and the fruit it bore, was
unexpectedly made to them, she was betrayed
into exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I cannot understand why it was!"</p>

<p>Whether the mother understood her or not,
she did not know. She hoped not; she was
sorry she had spoken. But presently the
mother roused herself to say gently:</p>

<p>"You girls were on your father's heart in
a strange way. That last talk about you I
must try to tell you of, when I can. The
substance of it I have told you. He thought
you both needed developing. Dora dear, he
said you needed more self-reliance; that
you had too many props, and depended
on them. He might have said the same of
me; I depended on him more than I knew.
He said you needed to be thrust out a little,
and learn to stand alone, and brave winds
and storms. And Claire, I don't think I fully
understood what he wanted for you, only he
said that you needed to trust less to your
own self, and lean on Christ."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>After this word from her father, Claire
sat in startled silence for a few minutes,
then took it to her room.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice that the storms of life
seem almost never to come in detached waves,
but follow each other in rapid succession?</p>

<p>When the Benedict family parted for the
night, less than a week after the father had
been laid in the grave, Dora said listlessly
to her sister:</p>

<p>"There is one little alleviation, I think, to
a heavy blow&mdash;for a while, at least, nothing
else seems heavy. Things that troubled me
last week seem so utterly foolish to-day. I
don't this evening seem to care for anything
that could happen to us now; to us three,
I mean."</p>

<p>Before noon of the next day she thought
of that sentence again with a sort of dull
surprise at her own folly.</p>

<p>How do such things occur? I can not
tell. Yet how many times in your life have
you personally known of them&mdash;families who
are millionnaires to-day, and beggars to-morrow?
It was just that sort of blow which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
came to the Benedicts. Came, indeed, because
of the other one, and followed hard
after it. Business men tried to explain matters
to the widow. A peculiar complication
of circumstances existed, which called for her
husband's clear brain and wise handling. Had
he lived, all would have been well; there
was scarcely a doubt of it. Had he been
able to give one week more to business, he
would have shaped everything to his mind;
but the call came just at the moment when
he could least be spared, and financial ruin
had followed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Benedict, in her widow's cap, with
her plaintive white face, her delicate, trembling
hands working nervously in her lap, from
which the crimson fancy work was gone,
tried to understand the bewilderments which,
one after another, were presented to her, and
grew less and less able to take in the meaning
of the great words, and at last raised
herself from her easy chair, looked round pitifully
for Claire, and sank back among the
cushions&mdash;her face, if possible, whiter than
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The elder daughter came swiftly forward
from her obscurity in the back parlor, and
stood beside her mother.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, gentlemen, but mamma does
not understand business terms; my father
never burdened her with them. Will you let
me ask you a few plain questions? Is my
father's money all gone?"</p>

<p>The gentlemen looked from one to another,
and hesitated. At last the lawyer among
them said he feared&mdash;that is, it was believed&mdash;it
seemed to be almost certain that when
all the business was settled, there would be
a mere pittance left.</p>

<p>The next question caused two red spots
to glow on Claire's cheeks, but she held her
head erect, and her voice was steady:</p>

<p>"And do they&mdash;does anybody think that
my father did wrong in any way?"</p>

<p>"Mamma," with a tender, apologetic glance
at her, "people say such things sometimes,
you know, when they do not understand."</p>

<p>But the gentlemen could be voluble now:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! no, indeed! not a breath of suspicion
attached to his name. His intentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
were as clear as the sunlight, and the fact
was, he had periled his own fortune in a
dangerous time, to help others who were in
straits, and he had been called to leave it at
a dangerous time, and disaster has followed."</p>

<p>One question more:</p>

<p>"Will others be sufferers through this disaster?"</p>

<p>The answer was not so ready. The gentlemen
seemed to find it necessary to look again
at one another. They, however, finally admitted,
to each other, that there was property
enough to cover everybody's loss, if that were
the wish of the family; this, without any
doubt, but there would be almost nothing
left.</p>

<p>"Very well," Claire said, "then we can
bear it. We thank you, gentlemen, and you
may be sure of this one thing&mdash;that no person
shall lose a penny through our father's
loss, if we can help it. Now, may I ask you
to leave further particulars until another time?
Mamma has borne as much as she can to-day."</p>

<p>And the gentlemen, as they went down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the steps of the great brownstone front, said
to each other that Benedict had left a
splendid girl, with self-reliance enough to manage
for herself and take care of the family.</p>

<p>Yet I suppose there had never been a time
when Claire Benedict felt more as though
all the powers which had hitherto sustained
her, were about to desert, and leave her helpless,
than she did when she controlled her
own dismay, and helped her mother to bed,
and sat beside her, and bathed her head,
and steadily refused to talk, or to hear her
mother talk, about this new calamity, but
literally hushed her into quiet and to sleep.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, she took time to cry, as few
girls cry; as Claire Benedict had never cried
before in her life.</p>

<p>Her self-reliance seemed gone. As the passion
of her voiceless grief swayed and fairly
frightened her, there stole suddenly into her
heart the memory of the last message:
"Claire needs to trust less to herself, and
lean on Christ."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>OUT IN THE WORLD.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>I&nbsp;&nbsp;AM not sure that I would, even if I could,
give you a detailed account of the days
which followed.</div>

<p>What is the use of trying to live pain
over again on paper? Yet some people need
practice of this sort to enable them to have
any idea of the sorrows of other hearts.</p>

<p>I wonder if you ever went through a large,
elegantly furnished house, from room to room,
and dismantled it? Packing away this thing
as far as possible from curious eyes, soiling
the velvet, or the satin, or the gilding of it,
perhaps, with bitter tears while you worked;
marking that thing with a ticket containing
two words which had become hateful to you,
"For sale;" hiding away some special treasure
in haste, lest the unexpected sight of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
might break a heart that was just now bearing
all it could. Has such experience ever
been yours? Then you know all about it,
and can in imagination follow Claire Benedict
from attic to basement of her father's
house; and no words of mine can make the
picture plainer. If it is something you have
never experienced, or even remotely touched,
you may think you are sympathetic, and you
may gravely try to be, but nothing that
printed words can say will be apt to help
you much in realizing the bitterness of such
hours.</p>

<p>Isn't it a blessed thing that it is so? Suppose
we actually bore on our hearts the individual
griefs of the world? How long would
our poor bodies be in breaking under the
strain? "He hath borne our griefs and carried
our sorrows." It took the Infinite to do this.</p>

<p>Through all the miseries of the two weeks
during which the process of dismantling went
on, Claire Benedict sustained her character
for self-reliance and systematic energy. She
stood between her mother and the world. She
interviewed carmen, and porters, and auctioneers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and talked calmly about the prices of
things, the thought of selling which made her
flesh fairly quiver.</p>

<p>She superintended the moving of heavy
furniture, and the packing of delicate glasses
and vases, after they had been chosen from
the home treasures at private sale.</p>

<p>She discussed with possible purchasers the
value of this or that carpet, and calculated
back to see how long it had been in use,
when the very bringing of it into the home
had marked an anniversary which made her
cheek pale and her breath come hard as she
tried to speak the date.</p>

<p>There were some who tried to shield her
from some of these bitter experiences. There
were kind offers of assistance; made, it is
true, in the main, by those who were willing,
but incompetent; but Claire was in the
mood to decline all the help she could. Do
her best, there was still so much help actually
required, that it made her blush to
think of it.</p>

<p>"There are a hundred things they want
to know," she would explain to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
begged her not to tear her heart and wear
her strength by walking through the rooms
with those who had come to purchase, possibly,
certainly to see, and to ask. "There
are a hundred things they want to know
that only mamma or I can tell them. It shall
never be mamma, and I would rather face
them and wait on them alone, than to creep
out at call, like an ashamed creature, to answer
their demands. There is nothing wicked about
it, and I ought to be able to bear what others
have had to."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was cruel work. She knew
when the two weeks of private sale were
over, and she stood battered and bruised in
soul, over the forlorn wrecks of the ruined
home, that she had not understood before
what a strain it was to be. She had almost
borne it alone. It was true, as she had said,
that it must be either mamma or herself.
Those who in all loving tenderness had tried
to help, realized this after the first day. "I
don't know, really; I will ask Miss Benedict,"
was the most frequent answer to the
endless questions. Dora's pitiful attempts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
help bear the burden seemed to give her
sister more pain than anything else. And
one day, when to the persistent questioning
of a woman in a cotton velvet sack, about
the first value of a Persian rug of peculiar
pattern and coloring, Dora dropped down on
a hassock in a burst of tears, and sobbed:
"Oh, I don't know how much it cost; but
I know papa brought it when he came from
Europe the day I was fourteen. Oh, papa,
papa, what shall I do!" Claire came from
the next room, calm, pale, cold as a statue,
just a swift touch of tenderness for Dora as
she stooped over her, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Run away, darling, I will attend to this,"
then she was ready to discuss the merits, possible
and probable, of the Persian rug, or of
anything else in the room. When the woman
in the sham velvet bunglingly attempted to
explain that she did not mean to hurt poor
Dora's feelings, she was answered quietly,
even gently, that no harm had been done,
that Dora was but a child. When the woman
was gone, without the Persian rug&mdash;the price
having been too great for her purse&mdash;Claire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
went swiftly to the sobbing Dora, and extracted
a promise from her that she would
never, no, never, attempt to enter one of the
public rooms again during those hateful two
weeks, and she kept her promise.</p>

<p>The next thing, now that the private sale
had closed, and Claire could be off guard,
was house-hunting. Not in the style of some
of her acquaintances, with whom she had explored
certain handsome rows of houses "for
rent," feeling secretly very sorry for them
that they had to submit to the humiliation of
living in rented houses and be occasionally
subject to the miseries of moving. Claire
Benedict had never moved but once, which
was when her father changed from his handsome
house on one avenue to his far handsomer
one on a grander avenue, which experience
was full of delight to the energetic
young girl. Very different was this moving
to be. She was not looking for a house;
she was not even looking for a handsome half
of a double house, which wore the air of belonging
to one family; nor could she even
honestly say she was looking for a "flat," because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
they must, if possible, get along with
even less room than this. To so low an estate
had they fallen in an hour!</p>

<p>You do not want me to linger over the
story, nor try to give you any of the shuddering
details. The rooms were found and
rented, Claire adding another drop to her
bitter cup by seeking out Judge Symonds as
her security. They were moved into; not
until they had been carefully cleaned and
brightened to the best of the determined
young girl's ability. Two carpets had been
saved from the wreck for mother's room and
the general sitting-room; and a pitiful, not to
say painful, effort had been made to throw
something like an air of elegance around
"mamma's room." She recognized it the moment
she looked on it, with lips that quivered,
but with a face that bravely smiled as she
said: "Daughter, you have done wonders."
She wanted, instead, to cry out: "Woe is
me! What shall I do?"</p>

<p>This little mother, used to sheltering hands,
had been a constant and tender lesson to
Claire all through the days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>She had not broken down, and lain down
and died, as at first Claire had feared she
would; neither had she wept and moaned as
one who would not be comforted. She had
leaned on Claire, it is true, but not in a way
that seemed like an added burden; it was
rather a balm to the sore heart to have
"mamma" gently turn to her for a decisive
word, and depend on her advice somewhat
as she had depended on the father.</p>

<p>It had not been difficult to get a promise
from her to have nothing to do with the
dreadful sales. "No, dear," she had said
quietly, when Claire made her plea, "I will
not try to help in that direction; I know
that I should hinder rather than help. You
can do it all, much better than I. You are
like your father, my child; he always took
the hard things, so that I did not learn
how."</p>

<p>The very work with which the mother
quietly occupied herself was pathetic. It had
been their pleasure to see her fair hands
busy with the bright wools, and silks and
velvets of fancy work, such as the restless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
young schoolgirl was too nervous to care for,
and the energetic elder daughter was too
busy to find time for. It had been their pride
to point to many delicate pieces of cunning
workmanship, and say they were "mamma's."</p>

<p>"So different from most other mothers,"
Dora would say, fondly and proudly.</p>

<p>But on the morning that the sale commenced,
the mother had gone over all the
wools, and silks, and canvas, and packed
them away with that unfinished piece of
crimson; and thereafter, her needle, though
busy, took the stitches that the discharged
seamstress had been wont to take. Claire
found her one day patiently darning a rent
in a fast breaking tablecloth, which had
been consigned by the housekeeper to the
drawer for old linen. Scarcely anything in
the history of the long, weary day touched
Claire so much as this.</p>

<p>Such power have the little things to sting
us! Some way we make ourselves proof
against the larger ones.</p>

<p>There had been very little about the experiences
of these trying weeks that had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
be brought before the family for discussion.
They were spared the pain of argument.
There had not been two minds about the
matter for a moment. Everything must go;
the creditors must be satisfied to the uttermost
farthing, if possible. That, as a matter
of course. Never mind what the law allowed
them. They knew nothing about the law,
cared nothing for it; they would even have
given up their keepsakes and their very
dresses, had there been need, and they could
have found purchasers.</p>

<p>But there had been no need. Disastrous
as the failure had been, it was found that
there was unincumbered property enough to
pay every creditor and have more furniture
left than they knew what to do with, besides
a sum of money; so small, indeed,
that at first poor Claire, unused to calculating
on such a small scale, had curled her
lip in very scorn, and thought that it might
as well have gone with the rest.</p>

<p>There came a day when they were settled
in those ridiculously small rooms, with every
corner and cranny in immaculate order, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
had reached the disastrous moment when
they might fold their hands and do nothing.
Alas for Claire! If there was one thing
that she had always hated, it was to do
nothing. She was almost glad that it was
not possible for her to do this. The absurd
little sum set to their credit in the First
National Bank, of which her father had for
so many years been a part, would barely
suffice to pay the ridiculously small rent of
these wretched rooms and provide her mother
with food and clothing. She must support
herself. She must do more than that: Dora
must be kept in school. But how was all
this to be done?</p>

<p>The old question! She had puzzled over
it a hundred times for some poor woman
on her list. She thought of them now only
with shivers. Executive ability? Dear! yes,
she had always been admired for having it.</p>

<p>But it is one thing to execute, when you
have but to put your hand in your pocket
for the money that is needed for carrying
out your designs; or, if there chance not to
be enough therein, trip lightly up the great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
granite steps of the all-powerful bank, ask
to see "papa" a minute, and come out replenished.
It was quite another thing when
neither pocket nor bank had aught for her,
and the first snows of winter were falling on
the father's grave.</p>

<p>She had one talent, marked and cultivated
to an unusual degree. She had thought of
it several times with a little feeling of assurance.
Everybody knew that her musical
education had been thorough in the extreme,
and that her voice was wonderful.</p>

<p>She had been told by her teachers many
a time that a fortune lay locked up in it.
Now was the time for the fortune to come
forth. She must teach music; she must secure
a position in which to sing on a
salary. Claire Benedict of two months ago
had been given to curling her lip just a
little over the thought that Christian young
men and women had to be paid for contributing
with their voices to the worship
of God on the Sabbath day. The Claire
Benedict of to-day, with that great gulf of
experience between her and her yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
said, with a sob, that she would never sneer
again at any honest thing which women did
to earn their living. She herself would become
a salaried singer.</p>

<p>Yes, but how bring it to pass? Did you
ever notice how strangely the avenues for
employment which have been just at your
side seem to close when there is need?
More than once had representatives of fashionable
churches said wistfully to Claire: "If
we could only have your voice in our
choir!" Now, a little exertion on her part
served to discover to her the surprising fact
that there were no vacancies among the
churches where salaried singers were in demand.</p>

<p>Yes, there was one, and they sought her
out. The offered salary would have been a
small fortune to her in her present need;
but she could not worship in that church;
she would not sing the praises of God merely
for money.</p>

<p>There was earnest urging, but she was firm.
There was a specious hint that true worship
could be offered anywhere, but Claire replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"But your hymns ignore the doctrine on
which I rest my hope for this life and for
the future."</p>

<p>It was a comfort to her to remember that
when she mentioned the offer to her mother
and sister, and said that she could not accept
it, her mother had replied, promptly: "Of
course not, daughter." And even Dora, who
was at the questioning age, inclined to toss
her head a little bit at isms and creeds,
and hint at the need for liberal views and
a broader platform, said: "What an idea! I
should have supposed that they would have
known better."</p>

<p>But it was the only church that offered.
Neither did Claire blame them. It was honest
truth; there was no opening. A year
ago&mdash;six months ago&mdash;why, even two
months ago, golden opportunities would have
awaited her; but just now every vacancy
was satisfactorily filled. Why should those
giving satisfaction, and needing the money,
be discharged, to make room for her who
needed it no less? Claire was no weak,
unreasoning girl who desired any such thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>As for two months ago, at that time the
thought of the possibility of ever being willing
to fill such a place had not occurred
to her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>AN OPEN DOOR.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>WELL, surely there was a chance to
teach music to private pupils? No,
if you will credit it, there was not even such
a chance! There was less reasonable explanation
for this closed door than the other.
Surely, in the great city, full of would-be
musicians, she might have found a corner!
Doubtless she would have done so in time,
but it amazed her as the days went by, and
one by one the pupils on whom she had
counted with almost certainty were found to
have excellent reasons why they ought to
remain with their present teacher, or why
they ought not to take up music for the
present.</div>

<p>In some cases the dilemma was real and
the excuse good. In others it was born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
simply of fear. Oh, yes, they knew that
Miss Benedict was a brilliant player, there
was not her equal in the city; and as for
her voice, it was simply superb; but then
it did not follow that a fine musician was
a fine teacher. She had not been educated
for a teacher; that had been the farthest
removed from her intention until necessity
forced it upon her. It stood to reason that
a girl who had been brought up in luxury,
and had cultivated her musical talent as a
passion, merely for her own pleasure, should
know nothing about the principles of teaching,
and have little patience with the drudgery
of it. They had always been warned
against broken-down ladies as teachers of
anything.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of this feeling;
and Claire, as she began to realize it more,
was kept from bitterness because of the
honesty of her nature. She could see that
there was truth in these conclusions; and
while she knew that she could give their
children such teaching as the parents might
have been glad to get, at any price, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
admitted that they could not know this as
she did, and were not to blame for caution.</p>

<p>She was kept from bitterness by one
other experience.</p>

<p>There came to see her one evening, a
woman who had done plain sewing for her
in the days gone by; whom she had paid
liberally and for whom she had interested
herself to secure better paid labor
than she had found her doing. This woman,
with a certain confused air, as of one asking
a favor, had come to say that she would
take it as a great thing, if her Fanny could
get into Miss Benedict's music class.</p>

<p>Miss Benedict explained kindly that she
had no music class, but if she should form
one in the city, it would give her pleasure
to count Fanny as one of her pupils, and
the mother could pay for it, if she wished,
in doing a little sewing for them some
time, when they should have sewing again
to do. The sentence ended with a sigh.
But the caller's embarrassment increased. She
even forgot to thank the lady for her gracious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
intention, and looked down at her
somewhat faded shawl, and twisted the
fringe of it, and blushed, and tried to stammer
out something. Claire began to suspect that
this was but a small part of her errand, and
to be roused to sympathy. Was there anything
else she could do for her in any way,
she questioned.</p>

<p>No! oh, no! there was nothing, only
would she&mdash;would it not be possible to
start a class with her Fanny, and let her
pay, not in sewing, but in money, and the
full value of the lessons, too; and here the
woman stopped twisting the fringe of her
shawl, and looked up with womanly dignity.
She was doing better, she said; a great
deal better than when Miss Benedict first
sought her out. Thanks to her, she had
plenty of sewing, as much as she could do,
and of a good, paying kind; and she had
thought&mdash;and here the shawl fringe was
twisted again&mdash;that is, she had supposed or
imagined&mdash;well, the long and short of it
was, sometimes all that things wanted was a
beginning, and she thought maybe if Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Benedict could be so kind as to begin with
Fanny, others would come in, and a good
class get started before she knew it.</p>

<p>There was a suspicious quiver of Claire's
chin as she listened to this, but her voice
was clear and very gentle as she spoke:</p>

<p>"Tell me frankly, Mrs. Jones, do you
think Fanny has a decided talent for music,
which ought to be cultivated? I don't
know the child, I think. Is she a singer?"</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Jones, all unused to subterfuge,
and at home in the realm of frankness,
was betrayed at once into admitting
that she had never thought of such a thing
as Fanny taking music lessons. No, she didn't
sing: at least, not but very little, and she
never said much about music; what she
wanted was to learn to draw, but she, Mrs.
Jones, had thought, as she said&mdash;and maybe
it was presumption in her to think so&mdash;that
what most things needed was to get
started. No sooner did she get started in
another kind of sewing, and among another
kind of customers, than work poured in on
her faster than she could do, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
thought Fanny would do maybe to start on.
Long before the conclusion of this sentence
the shawl fringe was suffering again.</p>

<p>Claire rose from her seat, and went over
and stood before Mrs. Jones, her voice still
clear and controlled:</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mrs. Jones, for your kind
thought. So far from being presumptuous,
it was worthy of your warm heart and unselfish
nature. I shall not forget it, and it
has done me good. But if I were you, I
would not have Fanny take music lessons,
and I would, if I could, give her drawing
lessons. I remember, now, your telling me
that she was always marking up her books
with little bits of pictures. She probably
has a good deal of talent in this direction,
and not for music; I would cultivate her
talents in the line in which they lie. Miss
Parkhurst has a drawing-class just commencing.
She is not very far from your corner,
on Clark street. I hope Fanny can go to
her, and if it would be any convenience to
you to pay the bills in sewing, I am quite
certain that Miss Parkhurst would be glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to do it. She was speaking about some
work of the kind only yesterday, and I recommended
you to her as one whom she
could trust."</p>

<p>So they dropped once more into their
natural characters, Claire the suggester and
helper, and Mrs. Jones the grateful recipient.
She went away thanked and comforted,
and convinced that Fanny ought to have a
chance at drawing, since Miss Benedict
thought she had a talent.</p>

<p>As for Claire, she went back to her mother
with two bright spots glowing on her cheeks,
and knelt down beside her chair, and said:</p>

<p>"Mamma, I have just had the most delicate
little bit of thoughtfulness shown me
that I ever received from the world outside,
and I'll tell you one thing it has settled; I
mean to accept the first opening, from whatever
source, that will take me away from
the city. I am almost sure there is no
work for me in this city."</p>

<p>Yet you are not to suppose that the great
world of friends who had been glad of their
recognition forgot them or ignored them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Much less are you to suppose that the great
church&mdash;of which Mr. Benedict was such a
prominent part that the projected entertainment
for which the young people had been
so nearly ready, missionary though it was,
was indefinitely postponed when he died&mdash;forgot
them or grew cold. Whatever the
world may do, or whatever solitary individuals
in the church may do under financial
ruins, the great heart of the true church
beats away for its own. And bravely they
rallied around the widow, and heartily they
tried to be helpful, and were helpful, indeed,
so far as warm words and earnest efforts
were concerned.</p>

<p>But they could not make vacancies for
Claire in the line in which her talents fitted
her to work. They could not make a strong
woman of the mother, able to shoulder burdens
such as are always waiting for strong
shoulders. They could and would have supported
them. For a time, at least, this
would have been done joyfully; they longed
to do it. They offered help in all possible
delicate ways. The trouble was, this family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
would have none of it. Grateful?&mdash;oh, yes,
but persistent in gently declining that which
was not an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>In the very nature of things, as the days
passed, they would be in a sense forgotten.
Claire saw this, and the mother saw it.
The rooms they had taken were very far
removed from the old church and the old
home and the old circle of friends. It consumed
hours of the day to make the journey
back and forth. Of course, it could
not be made often, nor by many. Of course,
the gaps which their changes had made
would be filled in time; it was not reasonable
to expect otherwise. Nobody expected
it, but it was very bitter.</p>

<p>And the very first open door that Claire
saw was an opportunity to teach music in a
little unpretentious academy, in a little unpretentious
town, away back among the hills,
two hundred miles from the city that had
always been her home.</p>

<p>It took talking&mdash;much of it&mdash;to reconcile
the mother and sister to the thought of a
separation. Through all their changes this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
one had not been suggested to their minds.
They had expected, as a matter of course,
to keep together. But necessity is a wonderful
logician. The bank account was alarmingly
small, and growing daily smaller. Even
the unpractical mother and sister could see
this. Something must be done, and here was
the open door. Why not enter it at once,
instead of waiting in idleness and suspense
through the winter for something better?
Thus argued Claire: "It will not be very
easy to leave you, mamma, as you may well
imagine," and here the sensitive chin would
quiver, "but I should feel safe in doing so,
for these ugly rooms are really very conveniently
arranged, and Dora would learn to
look after everything that Molly could not
do by giving two days of work in a week.
I have made positive arrangements with her
for two days, and she depends upon it; you
must not disappoint her. And, mamma, I
have thought of what papa said about us,"
here the low voice took on a tone of peculiar
tenderness, "perhaps Dora will learn self-reliance
if she is left to shield and care for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
you; it will be a powerful motive. You
know she leans on me now, naturally."</p>

<p>This was Claire's strongest argument, and,
together with the argument of necessity,
prevailed.</p>

<p>Barely four weeks from the "to-morrow"
which had contained her last bright plans, she
was installed as music teacher in the plain
little academy building situated in South Plains.</p>

<p>And now I know that I need not even
attempt to describe the sinking of heart
with which she moved down the shabby
narrow aisle, and seated herself in the uncushioned
pew of the shabby little church on
that first Sabbath morning.</p>

<p>Uncushioned! that was by no means the
worst of the pew's failings. The back was
at least four inches lower than it ought to
have been, even for so slight a form as
Claire's, and was finished with a moulding
that projected enough to form a decided
ridge. Of course, for purpose of support,
the thing was a failure, and, as to appearance,
nothing more awkward in the line of
sittings could be imagined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Fairly seated in this comfortless spot, the
homesick girl looked about her to take in
her dreary surroundings. Bare floors, not
over clean, the most offensive looking faded
red curtains flapping disconsolately against
the old-fashioned, small-paned soiled windows;
a platform, whose attempts at carpeting represented
a large-patterned, soiled ingrain rag,
whose colors, once much too bright for the
place, had faded into disreputable ghosts of
their former selves. The whole effect seemed
to Claire by far more dreary than the bare
floor of the aisles. A plain, square, four-legged
table, that had not even been dusted
lately, did duty as a pulpit desk, and a
plain, wooden-backed, wooden-seated chair
stood behind it. These were the sole attempts
at furnishing. The walls of this desolate
sanctuary seemed begrimed with the
smoke of ages; they were festooned with
cobwebs, these furnishing the only attempts
at hiding the unsightly cracks. The few
dreary-looking kerosene lamps disposed about
the room gave the same evidence of neglect
in their sadly smoked chimneys and general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
air of discouragement. However, had Claire
but known it, she had cause for gratitude
over the fact that they were not lighted, for
they could prove their unfitness for the
place they occupied in a much more offensive
way.</p>

<p>Such, then, in brief, was the scene that
greeted her sad eyes that morning. How
utterly homesick and disheartened she was!
It was all so different from the surroundings
to which she had all her life been
accustomed! She closed her eyes to hide the
rush of tears, and to think, foolish girl that
she was, of that other church miles and
miles away. She could seem to see familiar
forms gliding at this moment down the
aisles, whose rich carpets gave back no sound
of footfall. How soft and clear the colors
of that carpet were! A suggestion of the
delicately carpeted woods, and the shimmer
of sunlight on a summer day toward the
sun setting. She had helped to select that
carpet herself, and she knew that she had
an artist's eye for colors and for harmony.
It was not an extravagantly elegant church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>&mdash;as
city churches rank&mdash;that one to which
her heart went back, but just one of those
exquisitely finished buildings where every bit
of color and carving and design which meet
the cultured eye, rests and satisfies. Where
the law of harmony touches the delicately
frescoed ceiling, reaches down to the luxuriously
upholstered pews, finds its home in the
trailing vines of the carpet, and breathes
out in the roll of the deep-toned organ.</p>

<p>It was in such a church, down such a
broad and friendly aisle, that Claire Benedict
had been wont to follow her father and
mother on Sabbath mornings, keeping step
to the melody which seemed to steal of
itself from the organ, and fill the lofty
room. Can you imagine something of the
contrast?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>TRYING TO ENDURE.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>OF course there were other contrasts than
those suggested by the two churches
which persisted in presenting themselves to
this lonely girl.</div>

<p>How could she help remembering that in
the old home she had been Sidney Benedict's
daughter? A fact which of itself gave her
place and power in all the doings of the sanctuary.
Alas for the changes that a few brief
months can make!</p>

<p>Sidney Benedict lying in his grave, and
his daughter an obscure music-teacher in an
obscure boarding and day school; an object to
be stared at, and pointed out by the villagers
as the new teacher.</p>

<p>But for another contrast, which from some
divine source stole over her just then, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
hot tears which burned her eyes would surely
have fallen. Sidney Benedict was not sleeping
in the grave; that was only the house
of clay in which he had lived. She knew,
and suddenly remembered it with a thrill,
that his freed soul was in Heaven. What
did that mean? she wondered. In vain her
imagination tried to paint the contrast. There
had been times since his going when she
had longed with all the passion of her intense
nature to know by actual experience
just what Heaven is. But these were cowardly
moments. Generally, she had been able to
feel thankful that she was here to help mamma
and Dora. She remembered this now, along
with the memory of her father's joy, and it
helped her to choke back the tears, and
struggle bravely with her homesickness.</p>

<p>Meantime, it was hard for her to forget that
she was the observed of all observers. But
she did not half understand why this was
so. She could not know what a rare bit of
beauty she looked in the dingy church; almost
like a ray of brightness astray from another
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>From her standpoint, her dress was simplicity
itself; and she had not lived long
enough in this outer circle of society to understand
that there are different degrees of
simplicity, as well as different opinions concerning
the meaning of the word.</p>

<p>Her black silk dress was very plainly made,
and her seal sacque had been so long worn,
that Claire, the millionnaire's daughter, had
remarked only last winter that it had served
its time and must be supplanted by a new
one; the present Claire, of course, did not
think of such a thing, but meekly accepted
it as part of her cross!</p>

<p>Her plain black velvet hat had no other trimming
than the long plume which swept all
around it, and had been worn the winter before.
How could she be expected to have any
conception of the effect of her toilet on the
country people by whom she was surrounded.
Her world had been so far removed from
theirs, that had one told her that to them
she seemed dressed like a princess, she would
have been bewildered and incredulous.</p>

<p>Her dress was very far from suiting herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Her mood had been to envelop herself
in heaviest black, and shroud her face from
curious gaze behind folds of crape. The only
reason she had not done so, had been because
the strict sense of honor which governed
the fallen family would not allow them
to add thus heavily to their expenses. Indeed,
to have dressed in such mourning as
would have alone appeared suitable to them,
would have been impossible. The mother had
not seemed to feel this much. "It doesn't matter,
children," she had said gently; "they
know we miss papa; we have no need of crape
to help us tell that story, and for ourselves
it would not make our sorrow any less heavy."
But the girls had shrunk painfully from curious
eyes and conjectured curious remarks, and
had shed tears in secret over even this phase
of the trouble.</p>

<p>The bell whose sharp clang was a continued
trial to her cultured ears, ceased its twanging
at last, and then it was the wheezy little
cabinet organ's turn; and, indeed, those who
do not know the capabilities for torture that
some of those instruments have, are fortunate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Claire Benedict set her teeth firmly.
This was an hundred degrees more painful
than the bell, for the name of this was
music. How could any person be so depraved
in taste as to believe it other than a misnomer!</p>

<p>While the choir of seven voices roared
through the hymn, Claire shut her eyes,
grasped her hymn-book tightly with both
hands, set her lips, and endured. What a
tremendous bass it was! How fearfully the
leading soprano "sang through her nose,"
in common parlance, though almost everybody
understands that we mean precisely
opposite! How horribly the tenor flatted,
and how entirely did the alto lose the key
more than once during the infliction of those
six verses!</p>

<p>The hymn was an old one, a favorite with
Claire, as it had been with her father; but
as that choir shrieked out the familiar
words&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
I love her gates, I love the road,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The church adorned with grace,</span><br />
Stands like a palace built for God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To show his milder face,</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>it seemed hardly possible for one reared as
she had been, to turn from her surroundings
and lose herself in the deep spiritual meaning
intended. Nay, when the line,</div>

<div class='poem'>
Stands like a palace built for God,<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>was triumphantly hurled at her through
those discordant voices, she could hardly
keep her sad lips from curling into a sarcastic
smile, as she thought of the cracked
and smoky walls, the dreadful curtains, the
dust and disorder.</div>

<p>"A palace built for God!" her heart said
in disdain, almost in disgust. "It isn't a
decent stopping-place for a respectable man."</p>

<p>Then her momentary inclination to smile
yielded to genuine indignation. What possible
excuse could be offered for such a
state of things? Why did respectable people
permit such a disgrace? She had seen
at least the outside of several of the homes
in South Plains, and nothing like the disorder
and desolation which reigned here,
was permitted about those homes. How could
Christian people think they were honoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
God by meeting for his worship in a place
that would have made the worst housekeeper
among them blush for shame had it
been her own home.</p>

<p>Indignation helped her through the hymn,
and with bowed head and throbbing heart,
she tried, during the prayer, to come into
accord with the spirit of worship.</p>

<p>But the whole service was one to be remembered
as connected with a weary and
nearly fruitless struggle with wayward thoughts.
What was the burden of the sermon? She
tried in vain afterwards to recall it.</p>

<p>A series of well-meant and poorly expressed
platitudes. "Nothing wrong about it," thought
poor Claire, "except the sin of calling it
the gospel, and reading it off to these sleepy
people as though he really thought it might
do them some good!"</p>

<p>Indeed, the minister was almost sleepy himself,
or else utterly discouraged. Claire tried
to rouse herself to a little interest in him,
to wonder whether he were a down-hearted,
disappointed man. His coat was seedy, his
collar limp and his cuffs frayed at the edges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, these were actually some of the things
she thought while he said his sermon over
to them!</p>

<p>She brought her thoughts with sharp reprimand
back to the work of the hour, but
they roved again almost as quickly as recalled.
At last she gave over the struggle,
and set herself to the dangerous work of
wondering what Doctor Ellis was saying this
morning in the dear old pulpit; whether
mamma and Dora missed him as much as
she did; whether he looked over occasionally
to their vacant seat and missed all the
absent ones, papa most of all. But the seat
was not vacant, probably; already somebody
sat at the head of the pew in papa's place,
and somebody's daughters, or sisters, or
friends, had her place, and mamma's and
Dora's. The niches were filled, doubtless, and
the work of the church was going on just
the same, and it was only they who were
left out in the cold, their hearts bleeding
over a gap that would never be filled.
Dangerous thoughts, these!</p>

<p>One little strain in another key came in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
again to help her: Papa was not left out;
he had gone up higher. What was the old
church to him now that he had entered into
the church triumphant? He might love it
still, but there must be a little pity mingled
with the love, and a wistful looking forward
to the time when they would all reach to
his height, and at that time, mamma and
Dora and she would not be left out.</p>

<p>If this mood had but lasted, it would
have been well; but her undisciplined heart
was too much for her, and constantly she
wandered back to the thoughts which made
the sense of desolation roll over her.</p>

<p>She was glad when at last the dreary
service was concluded, and she could rush
away from the dreary church to the privacy
of her small, plain room in the academy,
and throw herself on the bed, and indulge
to the utmost the passionate burst of sorrow.</p>

<p>The tears spent their first force soon, but
they left their victim almost sullen. She
allowed herself to go over, in imagination,
the Sundays which were to come, and pictured
all their unutterable dreariness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Did I tell you about the rusty stoves,
whose rusty and cobwebby pipes seemed to
wander at their own erratic will about that
church? It was curious how poor Claire's
excited brain fastened upon those stovepipes
as the drop too much in her accumulation
of horrors. It seemed to her that she could
not endure to sit under them, no, not for
another Sabbath; and here was a long winter
and spring stretching out before her!
She was not even to go home for the spring
vacation; her poor, ruined purse would not
admit of any such extravagance. It would
be almost midsummer before she could hope
to see mamma and Dora again. And in the
meantime, how many Sundays there were!
She vexed herself trying to make out the
exact number and their exact dates.</p>

<p>This mood, miserable as it was, possessed
her all the afternoon. It seemed not possible
to get away from it. She crept forlornly
from her bed presently, because of
the necessity of seeing to her expiring fire.
She was shivering with the cold; but as she
struggled with the damp wood, trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
blow the perverse smoke into a flame, she
went on with her indignant, not to say defiant
thoughts. She went back again to
that dreadful church, and the fires in those
neglected stoves.</p>

<p>She determined resolutely that her hours
spent in that building should be as few as
possible. Of course, she must attend the
morning service; but nothing could induce
her to spend her evenings there.</p>

<p>"I might much better sit in my room
and read my Bible, and write good Sunday
letters to mamma and Dora," she told herself,
grimly, as the spiteful smoke suddenly
changed its course and puffed in her face.
"At least, I shall not go to church. I
don't belong to that church, I am thankful
to remember, and never shall; I have no
special duties toward it; I shall just keep
away from it and from contact with the
people here, as much as possible. It is
enough for me if I do my duty toward
those giggling girls who think they are to
become musicians under my tuition. I will
do my best for them, and I shall certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
earn all the salary I am offered here; then
my work in this place will be accomplished.
I have nothing to do with the horrors of
that church. If the people choose to insult
God by worshiping him in such an abomination
of desolations as that, it is nothing to
me. I must just endure so much of it as
I am obliged to, until I can get away from
here. I am not to spend my life in South
Plains, I should hope."</p>

<p>She shuddered over the possibility of this.
She did not understand her present state of
mind. She seemed to herself not Claire
Benedict at all, but a miserable caricature
of her. What had become of the strong,
bright, willing spirit with which she had
been wont to take hold of life? Energetic
she had always been called; "self-reliant,"
she had heard that word applied to herself
almost from childhood. "A girl who had a
great deal of executive talent." Yes, she
used to have; but she seemed now to have
no talent of any sort. She felt crushed; as
though the motive power had been removed
from her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>She had borne up bravely while with her
mother and younger sister. She had felt
the necessity for doing so; her mother's
last earthly prop must not fail her, and
therefore Claire had done her best. But
now there was no more need for endurance.
Her tears could not pain mamma or Dora;
she had a right to give her grief full sway.
She felt responsible to nobody. Her work
in the world was done. Not by any intention
of hers, she told herself drearily; she
had been willing and glad to work; she
had rejoiced in it, and had planned for a
vigorous and aggressive future, having to do
with the best interests of the church. Only
think how full of work her hours had been,
that day when the clouds shut down on
her and set her aside! There was nothing
more for her to do. Her plans were shattered,
her opportunities swept away, everything
had been cruelly interrupted; she could
not help it, and she knew no reason for
it; certainly she had tried to do her best.
But, at least, with her opportunities closed,
her responsibility was gone; nothing more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
could be expected of her; henceforth she
must just <i>endure</i>.</p>

<p>This is just the way life looked to the
poor girl on this sad Sabbath. She was still
trying to rely on herself; and because herself
was found to be such a miserable
source of reliance, she gloomily blamed her
hard fate, and said that at least her responsibility
was over. She did not say in
words&mdash;"God has taken away all my
chances, and he must just be willing to bear
the consequences of my enforced idleness;"
she would have been shocked had she supposed
that such thoughts were being nursed
in her heart; but when you look the matter
over, what else was she saying? A
great many of our half-formed thoughts on
which we brood, will not bear the clear
gaze of a quiet hour when we mean honest
work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>LIFTED UP.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT was a very quiet, cold-faced girl who
presently obeyed the summons to dinner.
Had it not been for those suspiciously
red eyes, and a certain pitiful droop of the
eyelids, Mrs. Foster would hardly have ventured
to break the casing of haughty reserve
in which her young music teacher had
decided to wrap herself.</div>

<p>A rare woman was Mrs. Foster. I wish
you knew her well; my pen pauses over
an attempt to describe her. I believe descriptions
of people never read as the writer
intended they should; and there never was
a woman harder to put on paper than this
same Mrs. Foster.</p>

<p>Ostensibly she was the principal of this
little academy, which was at present engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in reaping the results of years of
mismanagement and third-rate work. People
shook their heads when she took the position,
and said that she was foolish. She
would never earn her living there in the
world; the academy at South Plains was
too much run down ever to revive, and
there never had been a decent school there
anyway, and they didn't believe there ever
would be. And, of course, people of this
mind did what they could, with their tongues
and their apathy, so far as money and pupils
were concerned, to prove the truth of
their prophecies.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Foster, wise, sweet, patient woman
that she was, quietly bided her time,
and worked her way through seemingly endless
discouragements. She was after much
more than bread and butter. In reality
there was never a more persistent and patient
and wise and wary fisher for <i>souls</i>
found among quiet and little known human
kind than was Mrs. Foster. Had they but
known it, there were communities which
could have afforded to support her for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sake of the power she would have been in
their midst. Nay, there were fathers who
could have afforded to make her independent
for life, so far as the needs of this world
were concerned, for the sake of the influence
she would have exerted over their young
and tempted sons and daughters. But they
did not know it, and she, being as humble
as she was earnest, did not half know it
herself, and expected nothing of anybody
but a fair chance to earn her living, and
do all the good she could.</p>

<p>In point of fact, she had some difficulty
in getting hold of the little, badly-used academy
at South Plains. The people who
thought she was utterly foolish for attempting
anything so hopeless, were supplemented
by the people who thought she could not
be much, or she would never be willing to
come to South Plains Academy. So between
them they made it as hard for her as they
could.</p>

<p>Claire Benedict did not know it until
long afterwards, but the fact was, that during
her father's funeral services she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
been selected as the girl whom Mrs. Foster
wanted with her at South Plains. It happened,
so we are fond of saying, that Mrs.
Foster was spending a few days on business
in the city that had always been
Claire's home, and she saw how wonderfully
large portions of that city were stirred by
one death, when Sydney Benedict went to
heaven. She speculated much over the sort
of life he must have led to have gotten
the hold he had on the people. She began
to inquire about his family, about his children.
Then she heard much of Claire, and
grew interested in her, in a manner which
seemed strange even to herself. And when
at the funeral she first caught a glimpse of
the pale face and earnest eyes of the girl
who looked only, and with a certain watchful
air at her mother, as if she would shield
her from every touch that she could, Mrs.
Foster had murmured under her breath,
"I think this is the girl I want with me."
She prayed about it a good deal during the
next few days, and grew sure of it, and
waited only to make the way plain, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
she could venture her modest little offer,
and felt sure that if the Master intended it
thus, the offer would be accepted. And it
was, but in blindness, so far as Claire Benedict
was concerned. I have sometimes
questioned whether, if a bright angel had
come down out of heaven and stood beside
Claire, and said: "The King wants you to
go with all speed to South Plains; he has
special and important work for you there;
he has opened the way for you," the child
would not have been more content, and had
much less of the feeling that her work was
interrupted. But I do not know, she might
rather have said:</p>

<p>"Why in the world must I go to South
Plains? I had work enough to do at home,
and I was doing it; and now it will all
come to nought because there is no leader!
It stands to reason that I, in my poverty
and obscurity, down in that out-of-the-way
village, can not do as much as I, with my
full purse, and leisure days, and happy surroundings,
and large acquaintances could do
here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>We love to be governed by reason, and
hate to walk in the dark. I have always
wondered what Philip said when called to
leave his great meeting, where it seemed
hardly possible to do without him, and go
toward the south on a desert road. That
he went, and promptly, is, I think, a wonderful
thing for Philip.</p>

<p>Well, the red eyes of the young music-teacher
by no means escaped the watchful
ones of Mrs. Foster. Neither had her short,
almost sharp, negative in reply to a somewhat
timidly put question of a pupil, as to
whether she was going out to church that
evening. There were reasons why Mrs. Foster
believed that it would be much better for
her sad-hearted music-teacher to go to church
than to remain glooming at home. There
were, indeed, very special reasons on that
particular evening. The Ansted girls' uncle
was going to preach, she had heard, but
should she go to this young Christian, of
whom she as yet knew but little, and offer
as a reason for church-going that a stranger
was to preach instead of the pastor! However<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
she managed it, Mrs. Foster was sure
she would not do that. Yet it will give
you a hint of the little woman's ways when I
tell you that she was almost equally sure she
should manage it in some way.</p>

<p>Half an hour before evening service there
was a tap at Claire's door, and the principal
entered, and came directly to the point:
Would Miss Benedict be so kind as to accompany
Fanny and Ella Ansted to church
that evening? Miss Parsons was suffering
with sick headache, and she herself could
not leave her. There was no other available
chaperone for the young girls, who were not
accustomed to going out alone in the evening,
but who were unusually anxious to attend
church, as their uncle, who had been
stopped over the Sabbath by an accident,
was to preach.</p>

<p>Miss Benedict had her lips parted, ready
to say that she was not going out, but
paused in the act. What excuse could she
give? No sick headache to plead, and nobody
to care for; the night was not stormy,
if it was sullen, and the church was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
great distance away. She had been wont to
accommodate people always, but she never
felt so little like it as to-night. However,
there stood Mrs. Foster quietly awaiting an
answer, and her face seemed to express the
belief that of course, the answer would be
as she wished.</p>

<p>"Very well," came at last from the teacher's
lips, and she began at once to make
ready.</p>

<p>"It is for this I was hired," she told herself
bitterly. "I must not forget how utterly
changed my life is in this respect as in all
others. I am my own mistress no longer,
but even in the matter of church-going must
hold myself at the call of others."</p>

<p>As for the principal, as she closed the
door with a gentle "Thank you," she told
herself that it was much better for the poor
child to go; and that she must see to it
what she could do during the week to brighten
that room a little.</p>

<p>The stuffy church was the same; nay, it
was more so, for every vile lamp was lighted
now, and sent a sickly, smoky shadow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the ceiling, and cast as little light upon the
surrounding darkness as possible. But the
uncle! I do not know how to describe to
you the difference between him and the
dreary reader of the morning! It was not
simply the difference in appearance and voice,
though really these were tremendous, but he
had a solemn message for the people, and not
only for the people whose Sabbath home was in
that church, but for Claire Benedict as well.</p>

<p>She did not think it at first. She smiled
drearily over the almost ludicrous incongruity
of the text as measured by the surroundings.
"If I prefer not Jerusalem above my
chief joy."</p>

<p>The folly of supposing that any sane person
preferred such a desolate, modern Jerusalem
as this above his chief joy! The
very care with which the men brushed a
clear spot for their hats on the dusty seats,
and the manner in which the women gathered
their dresses about them, to keep them
from contact with the floor, showed the
place which the sanctuary held in their affections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>But as the preacher developed his theme,
it would almost seem that he had selected
it for Claire Benedict's special benefit. It
was not what had been done, or was being
done, that he desired to impress, but rather
what ought to be done.</p>

<p>The earthly Jerusalem, instead of being
one particular church building, was any
church of Christ where a Christian's lot was
cast, even for a single Sabbath. He or she
was bound by solemn covenant vows to do
all for that church which lay in his or her
power; as fully, as unreservedly, as though that
church, and that alone, represented his or
her visible connection with the great Head.
What solemn words were these, breaking in
on the flimsy walls of exclusiveness which
this young disciple had been busy all the
afternoon building up about her! The church
at South Plains her place of service! actually
bound to it by the terms of her covenant!</p>

<p>Others had their message from that plainly-worded,
intensely-earnest sermon. I have no
doubt there was a special crumb for each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
listener&mdash;it is a peculiarity belonging to
any real breaking of the bread of life&mdash;but
Claire Benedict busied herself with none
of them. Her roused and startled heart
had enough to do to digest the solid food
that was given as her portion.</p>

<p>The truth was made very plain to her
that she had no more right to build a shell
and creep into it, and declare that this
church, and this choir, and this Sunday-school,
and this prayer-meeting, yes, and
even this smoking stove and wheezing organ,
were nothing to her because she was to
stay in South Plains but a few months,
and her home was far away in the city,
than she had to say that she had nothing
to do with the people or the places on
this earth, no sense or responsibility concerning
them, no duties connected with
them, because she was to be here only for
a few years and her home was in heaven.</p>

<p>Gradually this keen-edged truth seemed
to penetrate every fibre of her being. This
very church, cobweb-trimmed, musty-smelling,
was for the time being her individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
working ground, to be preferred above her
chief joy! Nay, the very red curtain that
swayed back and forth, blown by the north
wind which found its way through a hole
in the window, and which she <i>hated</i>, became
a faded bit of individual property for
which she was, in a sense, responsible.</p>

<p>She walked home almost in silence. The
girls about her chattered of the sermon;
pronounced it splendid, and admitted that
they would just a little rather hear Uncle
Eben preach than anybody else, and it was
no wonder that his people almost worshiped
him, and had raised his salary only last
month. Claire listened, or appeared to, and
answered directly put questions with some
show of knowledge as to what was being
discussed; but for herself, Dr. Ansted had
gone out of her thoughts. She liked his
voice, and his manner, and his elocution,
but the force behind all these had put
them all aside, and the words which repeated
themselves to her soul were these:
"If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief
joy!" What then? Why, then I am false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to my covenant vows, and the possibilities
are that I am none of His.</p>

<p>Mrs. Foster was in the hall when the
party from the church arrived. Wide open
as to eyes and mental vision, quiet as to
voice and manner, she had staid at home
and ministered to the victim of sick headache.
She had been tender and low-voiced,
and deft-handed, and untiring; but during
the lulls when there had been comparative
quiet, she had bowed her head and prayed
that the sad-hearted young music-teacher
might meet Christ in his temple that evening,
and come home up-lifted. She did not
know how it was to be done.</p>

<p>She knew nothing about the Ansted uncle
save that he was an ambassador of
Christ, and she knew that the Lord <i>could</i>
use the shabbily-dressed ambassador of the
morning as well as he; she did not rely on
the instruments, except as they lay in the
hand of God. She did not ask for any
special thought to be given to Claire Benedict;
faith left that, too, in the hand of the
Lord. She only asked that she should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ministered unto, and strengthened for the
work, whatever it was that he desired of
her. And she needed not to question, to
discover that her prayer, while she had yet
been speaking, was answered. The music-teacher
did not bring home the same
thoughts that she had taken away with her.</p>

<p>She went swiftly to her room. The fire
had been remembered, and was burning
brightly.</p>

<p>The first thing she did was to feed its
glowing coals with the letter that had been
commenced to mamma and Dora during
the afternoon. Not that there had been
anything in it about her heaped-up sorrows,
or her miserable surroundings, or her gloomy
resolves, but in the light of the present
revelation she did not like the tone of it.</p>

<p>She went to her knees, presently, but it
would have been noticeable there that she
said almost nothing about resolves, or failures.
Her uttered words were brief; were, indeed,
only these: "Dear Christ, it is true I needed
less of self and more of thee. Myself has
failed me utterly; Jesus, I come to thee."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>"OUR CHURCH."</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE dreary weather was not gone by
the next morning. A keen wind was
blowing, and ominous flakes of snow were
fluttering their signals in the air; but the
music-room was warm, and the music-teacher
herself had gotten above the weather. She
was at the piano, waiting for the bell to
ring that should give the signal for morning
prayers.</div>

<p>Around the stove were gathered a group
of girls who had hushed their voices at
her entrance. They were afraid of the pale
music-teacher. Hitherto they had regarded
her with mingled feelings of awe and dislike.</p>

<p>Her very dress, plain black though it
was, with its exquisite fit and finish, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to mark her as belonging to another world
than themselves. They expected to learn
music of her, but they expected nothing
else.</p>

<p>It was therefore with a visible start of
surprise that they received her first advances
in the shape of a question, as she
suddenly wheeled on the piano-stool and
confronted them:</p>

<p>"Girls, don't you think our church is
just dreadful?"</p>

<p>Whether it was a delicate tact, or a sweet
spirit born of the last evening's experience,
that led Claire Benedict to introduce that
potent little "our" into her sentence, I will
leave you to judge.</p>

<p>It had a curious effect on the girls around
the stove. These bright-faced, keen-brained,
thoroughly-good girls, who had lived all
their lives in a different atmosphere from
hers. They were good scholars in algebra,
they were making creditable progress in
Latin, and some of them were doing fairly
well in music; but they could no more set
their hats on their heads with the nameless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
grace which hovered around Claire Benedict's
plainly-trimmed plush one, than they
could fly through the air. This is just one
illustration of the many differences between
them. This young lady had lived all her days
in the environments of city culture; they
had caught glimpses of city life, and it
meant to them an unattainable fairy-land,
full of lovely opportunities and probabilities,
such as would never come to them. It
struck every one of those girls as a peculiarly
pleasant thing that their lovely music-teacher
had said "our" instead of "your."</p>

<p>One of the less timid presently rallied
sufficiently to make answer:</p>

<p>"Dreadful? It is just perfectly horrid!
It fairly gives me the blues to go to church.
Girls, mother has almost spoiled her new
cashmere sweeping the church floor with it.
She says she would be ashamed to have
our wood-shed look as badly as that floor
does. I don't see why the trustees allow
such slovenliness."</p>

<p>"It is because we can not afford to pay
a decent sexton," sighed one of the others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
"We are so awful poor! That is the cry
you always hear if there is a thing said.
I don't believe we deserve a church at all."</p>

<p>Claire had partially turned back to the
piano, and she touched the keys softly, recalling
a long-forgotten strain about "Girding
on the armor," before she produced her
next startling sentence.</p>

<p>"Girls, let us dress up that church until
it doesn't know itself."</p>

<p>If the first words had astonished them,
this suggestion for a moment struck them
dumb. They looked at one another, then
at the resolute face of the musician. Then
one of them gasped out:</p>

<p>"Us girls?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!" from two dismayed
voices.</p>

<p>"How could we do anything?" from a
gentle timid one.</p>

<p>"But the girl who had found courage to
speak before, and to volunteer her opinion
as to the disgraced church, sounded her
reply on a different note:</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right away," said the music teacher,
smiling brightly on them all, but answering
only the last speaker.</p>

<p>Then she left the piano, and came over
to the centre of the group, which parted
to let her in.</p>

<p>"Just as soon as we can, I mean. We
must first secure the money; but I think
we can work fast, with such a motive."</p>

<p>Then came the chorus of discouragements:</p>

<p>"Miss Benedict, you don't know South
Plains. We never can raise this money in
the world. It has been tried a dozen different
times, and there are a dozen different
parties, as sure as we try to do anything.
Some people won't give toward the
old church, because they want a new one.
As if we could ever have a new church!
Others think it is well enough as it is, if it
could be swept now and then. And there
is one woman who always goes to talking
about the time she gave the most for that
old rag of a carpet on the platform, and
then they went and bought it at another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
store instead of at theirs, where they ought
to, and for her part, she will never give
another cent toward fixing up that church."</p>

<p>Another voice chimed in:</p>

<p>"Yes; and there is an old man who says
honesty comes before benevolence. He
seems to think it would be quite a benevolence
to somebody to fix up that old rookery;
and they owe him ten dollars for coal,
and they will never prosper in the world
until they pay him."</p>

<p>"Is it true about the society owing him?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am; it isn't. Father says they
paid him more than the coal was worth.
He is an old scamp. But it is just a specimen
of the way things go here; hundreds
of reasons seem to pop up to hinder people
from doing a thing; and all the old stories
are raked up, and after awhile everybody
gets mad with everybody else, and won't
try to do anything. You never saw such
a place as South Plains."</p>

<p>But the music-teacher laughed. She was
so sure of what ought to be done, and
therefore, of course, of what could be done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that she could afford to laugh over the ludicrous
side of this doleful story.</p>

<p>The girls, however, did not see the ludicrous
side.</p>

<p>"It makes me cold all over, just thinking
about trying to beg money in South Plains
for anything; and for the church most of
all!"</p>

<p>To be sure this was Nettie Burdick's
statement, and she was noted for timidity;
but none of the bolder ones controverted
her position.</p>

<p>But Miss Benedict had another bomb-shell
to throw into their midst.</p>

<p>"Begging money is dreadful work, I suppose.
I never did much of it. My collecting
route lay among people who were
pledged to give just so much, and who as
fully expected to pay it when the collector
called, as they expected to pay their gas
bill or their city taxes. But don't let us
think of doing any such thing. Let us
raise the money right here among ourselves."</p>

<p>Blank silence greeted her. Had she been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
able to look into their hearts, she would
have seen something like this: Oh, yes! it
is all very well for you to talk of raising
money. Anybody can see by your dress,
and your style, and everything, that you
have plenty of it; but if you expect money
from us, you don't know what you are talking
about. The most of us have to work
so hard, and coax so long to get decent
things to wear, that we are almost tired of
a dress or a bonnet before it is worn. But
this they did not want to put into words.
Neither did Miss Benedict wait for them.</p>

<p>"We must earn it, of course, you know."</p>

<p>"Earn it! How?" Half a dozen voices
this time.</p>

<p>"Oh, in a dozen ways," smiling brightly.
"To begin with, there is voluntary contribution.
Perhaps we can not all help in that
way, but some of us can, and every little
helps. My salary, for instance, is three hundred
a year."</p>

<p>She caught her breath as she said this,
and paled a little. It was much less than
Sydney Benedict had allowed his daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
for spending money; but to those girls it
sounded like a little fortune.</p>

<p>"That is twenty-five dollars a month,
and a tenth of that is two dollars and a
half. Now I propose to start this scheme
by giving the 'tenths' of two months' salary.
Come, Nettie, get your pencil, and be
our secretary. We might as well put it in
black and white, and make a beginning."</p>

<p>"Do you always give a tenth of everything
you have?"</p>

<p>It was Nannie Howard's question, asked
in a hesitating, thoughtful tone, while Nettie
blushing and laughing, went into the
depths of her pocket for a pencil, tore a
fly-leaf from her algebra, and wrote Miss
Benedict's name.</p>

<p>"Always!" said the music-teacher, gently,
her lip trembling and her voice quivering a
little. "It was my father's rule. He taught
it to me when I was a little, little girl."</p>

<p>They could not know how pitiful it seemed
to her that the daughter of the man who
had given his annual thousands as tenths,
had really to spend an hour in planning, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
that she might see her way clear toward
giving two dollars and a half a month!
Not that this young Christian intended to
wait until she could see her way clear.
Her education had been, The tenth belongs
to God. As much more as you can conscientiously
spare, of course; but this is to
be laid aside without question. Her education,
built on the rock of Christian principle,
had laid it aside as a matter of course, and
then her human nature had lain awake and
planned how to get along without it, and
yet not draw on the sacred fund at the
bank.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is a good rule," Mary
Burton said, "though I never thought of
doing such a thing. Well," after another
thoughtful pause, "I may as well begin, I
suppose. I have a dollar a month to do
what I like with. I'll give two dollars to
the fund."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Miss Benedict. "Why, girls,
we have a splendid beginning."</p>

<p>But Mary Burton was an exception; not
another girl in the group had an allowance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
A few minutes of total silence followed;
then a new type of character came to the
front.</p>

<p>"Father gave me a dollar this morning
to get me a new pair of gloves; but I suppose
I can make the old ones do. I'll give
that."</p>

<p>"O, Kate! your gloves look just horrid."
This from a younger sister.</p>

<p>"I know they do, but I don't care," with
a little laugh that belied the words; "so
does the church."</p>

<p>"That's true," said Anna Graves. "It
gives one the horrors just to think of it.
I gave up all hope of its being fixed, long
ago, because I knew the men would never
do it in the world; but if there is anything
we can accomplish, let's do it. I say we
try. I was going to trim my brown dress
with velvet. It will cost two dollars. I'll
give it up and trim with the same. Nettie
Burdick, put me down for two dollars."</p>

<p>This, or something else, set the two timid
ones, who were sisters, to whispering; presently
they nodded their heads in satisfaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Whatever their plan was, they kept it to
themselves. It undoubtedly included self-sacrifice,
as they belonged to a family who
honestly had but little from which to give,
but they presently directed that their names
be set down for a dollar each.</p>

<p>Apparently, the crowning bit of sacrifice
came from Ruth Jennings.</p>

<p>"Father has been promising me a piano-stool
for more than a year," she explained,
laughing. "This morning he gave me the
money, and I have a note written to Benny
Brooks to bring it down with him next
Saturday; but I do so dreadfully hate those
red curtains, that if you will promise to do
something with the windows the first thing,
I'll sit on the dictionary and the Patent
Office Reports for another year. A stool
such as I was going to get, costs four dollars.
Put it down, Nettie, quick!"</p>

<p>A general clapping of hands ensued. Not
a girl present but appreciated that to Ruth
Jennings this was quite a sacrifice. As for
Miss Benedict, her eyes were brimming.</p>

<p>"You dear girls," she said, eagerly, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
feel as though I wanted to kiss every one
of you. We will certainly have our church
made over. I feel sure of it now. I think
some of you must prefer it above your
chief joy."</p>

<p>This called forth a chorus of voices:</p>

<p>"O, Miss Benedict, you don't think that
velvet ribbons, and gloves, and such things,
are our chief joys, do you?"</p>

<p>"Or even piano-stools!" This from Ruth
Jennings, amid much laughter. But Miss
Benedict's face was grave.</p>

<p>"Has the <i>church</i> been?" She asked the
question gently, yet in a sufficiently significant
tone.</p>

<p>The reply was prompt.</p>

<p>"I should think not! Such a horrid old
den as it is! How could there be any joy
about it!"</p>

<p>The words of the evening's text were repeating
themselves so forcibly in their teacher's
heart that she could not refrain from quoting:
"Let my tongue cleave to the roof of
my mouth, if I prefer not Jerusalem above
my chief joy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The laughter was hushed.</p>

<p>"But that doesn't mean the building, does
it, Miss Benedict?"</p>

<p>"The building is the outward sign of His
presence, is it not? And suggests one of
the ways in which we can show our love
for the God to whose worship the church
is dedicated?"</p>

<p>As she spoke she wound an arm around
the young girl's waist, and was answered,
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"I suppose so. It seems wrong to talk
about worshipping God in a place that is
not even clean, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>How familiar they were growing with
their pretty young teacher, of whom they
had thought, only the day before, that they
should always be afraid.</p>

<p>"Isn't she sweet?"</p>

<p>This question they repeated one to another,
as, in answer to the bell summoning them
to morning prayers, they moved down the
hall.</p>

<p>"So quick-witted and so unselfish!" said
a second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"And not a bit 'stuck up'!" declared a
third.</p>

<p>And with their brains throbbing with new
ideas, they went in to prayers. They glanced
at one another and smiled, when Mrs. Foster
announced the hymn,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Work, for the night is coming,<br />
Work through the morning hour.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>They every one meant to work.</div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>MAKING OPPORTUNITIES.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THEN began a new era in the life of
the girls at South Plains Academy.
They had work to do. A common interest
possessed them. They had a leader; such
an one as they had never known before.
She was capable of originating and guiding.
She not only knew how to talk, but how
to <i>do</i>.</div>

<p>Committee meetings became the fashion of
the day. No time now for loitering over
lessons, no weary yawning behind the covers
of wearisome text-books.</p>

<p>Promptly at four o'clock was to be a
meeting of importance. It would be "just
horrid" to be detained in the recitation-room
over an imperfectly-prepared lesson,
while the others hastened to Miss Benedict's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
room, to be met with her questioning as to
the where and why of the absent member.
Mrs. Foster had never seen better work done
than went on among her girls during the
weeks that followed.</p>

<p>There was need for committee meetings,
and for almost endless discussions of ways
and means. The voluntary offerings were
all in, and though each had done her best,
all knew that the sum total was meager
enough. Money must certainly be earned,
but the grave question was, How?</p>

<p>"Oh, there are ways," declared Miss Benedict,
with a confidence that of itself inspired
courage. "Of course, there are a good
many ways; and we must think them up.
Earning money is never very easy business,
and we must begin by understanding, that
as a matter of course, there is work, and
disagreeable work, of some sort, in store for
each one of us."</p>

<p>The girls, each and all, declared themselves
ready for work, but totally in the
dark. They knew how to save money, the
most of them, provided they could get hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of any to save; but as for earning it, they
really had never earned a cent in their
lives. There had been no opportunity, so
they declared.</p>

<p>"We will make opportunities," announced
the brave young leader, to whom money had
hitherto flowed in an unbroken stream. But
her courage was contagious, as true courage
often is, and the girls laughed, and announced
themselves as ready, even to <i>make</i>
opportunities, if somebody would show them
how.</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Miss Benedict; her
head dropped a little to one side, her chin
resting on her hand in the attitude that she
used to assume, when Dora said she was
planning a house and lot for some protégé.
"To begin with, there are things to be sold
by agencies."</p>

<p>Two or three girls gravely shook their
heads; one shrugged her shoulders as an
evidence of dismay, not to say disgust, and
Ruth Jennings spoke:</p>

<p>"Book agents! We can't do it, Miss
Benedict. There are not three people in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
South Plains who ever think of buying a
book. One of the creatures canvassed the
whole town last summer; was in every house
within three miles, and she sold just four
books. A good book it was, too; but the
people who had money to spare didn't want
it, and the people who wanted it hadn't
the money. I was never more sorry for anybody
in my life than I was for that poor
girl, who wore out a pair of shoes and a
pair of gloves, and spoiled her bonnet, to
say nothing of her temper. And she was
voted the greatest nuisance we ever had in
this village, and that is saying a great
deal."</p>

<p>Miss Benedict laughed merrily. Ruth's
voluble tongue always amused her.</p>

<p>"I don't mean books," she explained.
"There are other things; for instance, hair-pins."</p>

<p>The sentence closed with a little laugh,
and seemed to be suggested by the dropping
of one of the gleaming things at that
moment from her hair; but there was that
in her voice which made the girls think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
there was a real suggestion hidden in it,
though they could not see how.</p>

<p>"Hair-pins!" repeated Ruth, in puzzled
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes: really and truly, not metaphorically.
I bought some last night at the store
in the village; the best, the clerk gravely
assured me, that were to be had. Wretched
things! I wore one for an hour, then threw
it in the stove; it seemed to me that it
pulled each hair of my head during that
one hour. Look at the kind we ought to
have!" Whereupon she drew the gleaming
thing out again, and passed it around for
minute scrutiny. "Blued steel, they are, you
see; that is the trade mark; each one is finished
to a high degree of smoothness. One who
has used a single paper of them could not
be persuaded to content herself with any
other kind. Cheap they are, too. Actually
cheaper than those instruments of torture I
bought last night. I sent to my sister by the
morning mail, to send me a box forthwith.
That suggested the business to me, I presume.
There are worthless imitations, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the genuine sort can be bought by the
quantity very cheaply indeed, and a respectable
profit might be made on them until the
people were supplied. It isn't as though we
were at work in a city, where women could
supply themselves without any trouble. It is
a work of genuine mercy, I think, to rescue
the ladies from those prongs to which they
have to submit."</p>

<p>"Turn hair-pin pedlers!" said Mary Burton.
There was a laugh on her face, but
the slightest upward curve to her pretty lip.
Mary felt above the suggestion.</p>

<p>Her father was a farmer, decidedly well-to-do,
and owned and lived in one of the
prettiest places about South Plains.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the millionnaire's daughter,
who had lived all her life in a palatial
home such as Mary Burton could not even
imagine, "pedlers, if you like the name;
why not? It is a good, honest business, if
one keeps good stock, and sells at honest
prices.</p>

<p>"I like it very much better than selling
cake, and flowers, and nuts, and candy, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the church, at wicked prices, in the name
of benevolence."</p>

<p>There was a general laugh over this hint.
South Plains had had its day at such work
as this, and those girls knew just how
"wicked" the prices were, and how questionable
the ways which had been resorted
to in order to secure customers.</p>

<p>"I'd as soon sell hair-pins as anything
else," affirmed Ruth Jennings. "I would
like some of them myself; we always get
wretched ones down at the corner store.
But, Miss Benedict, do you believe much
could be made just out of hair-pins?"</p>

<p>"Not out of hair-pins alone; but there
are other things, plenty of them; little conveniences,
you know, that people do not
think of, until they are brought to their
doors, and that are so cheap, it seems a
pity not to buy them, if only for the sake
of getting pleasantly rid of a nuisance."
This with a merry glance at Ruth.</p>

<p>"For instance, there are some charming
little calendar cards being gotten up for the
holiday sales, on purpose for the children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
They are mounted on an easel, and contain
a Bible verse for every day in the
year, with a bit of a quotation from some
good author, in verse, you know; exquisite
little selections, just suited to children; on
each Sabbath the card contains the Golden
Text of the Sabbath-school lesson. They are
just as pretty as possible, and retail for
twenty cents. I don't believe there are many
mothers who could resist the temptation of
buying one for their children. But useful
things, viewed from a practical standpoint,
sell the best. I have always heard that the
country was the place to get pies, and custards,
and all such good things?"</p>

<p>"It is," said one of the girls, with a confident
nod of her head. "This is the greatest
place for pies you ever saw! I know
people who have a pie of some sort for
breakfast, dinner and supper. No use in
trying to start a bakery here. People all
make their own, and plenty of it."</p>

<p>Miss Benedict looked her satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Then there are plenty of burnt fingers,
I am sure. Nettie, my dear, you said you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
helped your mother on Saturday, which I
suppose is baking-day. How many times have
you blistered your poor little fingers trying
to lift out a hot and heavy pie from the
oven?"</p>

<p>"More times than I should think of trying
to count; and, for that matter, I have
done a great deal worse than to burn my
fingers. Only last Saturday I tipped a pumpkin
pie upside down on the floor; mother's
clean floor, it had just been mopped. The
tin was hot, you see, and the cloth slipped
somehow, so that my bare fingers came right
on the hottest part, and I just squealed, and
dropped the whole thing. Oh, such a mess!"</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Miss Benedict, looking
unsympathetically pleased with the story. "I
have no doubt that we should find quite a
noble army of martyrs among you in that
very line, or among your mothers; you girls
would be more likely to 'squeal and drop
it,' as Nettie has said. But now I want to
know what is to hinder us from being benefactors
to our race, and earning an honest
penny in the bargain, by sending for a box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
full of pie-lifters, and offering one to every
housekeeper in South Plains? They are
cheap, and I don't believe many pie-bakers
would refuse one."</p>

<p>"Pie-lifters!" "I never heard of such an
institution." "What in the world are they?"
Three questioning voices.</p>

<p>"Oh, just ingenious little pieces of iron,
so contrived that they will open and shut
like an old-fashioned pair of tongs, only
much more gracefully; they adjust themselves
to the size of the tin, or plate, and close
firmly, so that even a novice can lift the
hottest pumpkin pie that ever bubbled, and
set it with composure and complacency on
the table at her leisure."</p>

<p>"I should think they would be splendid!"</p>

<p>This, in varying phraseology, was the
general vote.</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you of one of the greatest
nuisances out. Look here! Did you ever
see a more starched-up linen cuff than this
is?"</p>

<p>The girls looked admiringly. No; they
never did. It shone with a lovely polish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the means of securing which was unknown
to the most domestic of them.</p>

<p>"Well," explained Miss Benedict, "it isn't
linen at all. By the way, I am trying to
economize in laundry work. It is nothing
but paper, but with such a good linen
finish that nobody ever discovers it, and
they answer every purpose. I find they don't
keep them at the corner store, and your
young gentleman friends would like them, I
am sure. They can be had at the factory
very reasonably, indeed. I shouldn't wonder
if we would better invest in some. But
that was not what I started out to say.
When you get a pair of cuffs nicely laundried,
so that they are stiff and shining,
how do you enjoy struggling with them to
get the cuff button in, or to get it out&mdash;especially
if you are in a hurry?"</p>

<p>This query produced much merriment
among two of the girls, which the elder
sister presently explained:</p>

<p>"You ought to ask that question of our
brother Dick. He does have the most trying
times with his cuff buttons. He wants his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
cuffs so stiff they can almost walk alone,
and then he fusses and struggles to get the
buttons in so as not to break the cuff.
He is just at the age, Miss Benedict, to be
very particular about such things, and sometimes
he gets into such a rage. Last Sunday
he split one of his buttons in half a
dozen pieces tugging at it. I tried to help
him, but I couldn't get the thing in; they
are a dreadful nuisance."</p>

<p>"Ah, but look at this." A sudden, dexterous
movement, and the button was
standing perpendicularly across the button-hole,
and could be slipped in or out with
perfect ease.</p>

<p>The girls looked and admired and exclaimed.
They had never seen such a contrivance.</p>

<p>"But they are very expensive, are they
not?" This question came from the ever-practical
Ruth.</p>

<p>Miss Benedict readjusted her cuff with a
sudden quivering of the lip, as a rush of
memories swept over her. Those heavy gold
cuff buttons, with their rare and delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
designs, had been among her father's gifts,
less than a year ago.</p>

<p>"These are rather so," she said presently,
struggling to keep her voice steady, "but the
device for opening and shutting is introduced
into plain buttons, which can be had for
twenty-five cents a set; and I think they are
a great comfort especially to young men."</p>

<p>This is only a hint of the talk. It was
continued at several meetings, and plans at
last were perfected, and orders made out
and sent to the city for a dozen or more useful
articles, none of them bulky, all of them cheap.
The arrangement was, that each young lady
should take her share of the articles, keep her
individual account, and thenceforth go armed;
hair-pins and cuff buttons in her pocket,
ready, as opportunity offered, to suggest to
a friend the advisability of making a desirable
purchase. If she went to a neighbor's
of an errand, she was in duty bound to
take a pie-lifter under her shawl, and describe
its merits. Did she meet a reasonably-indulgent
mother, out were to come the pretty
calendar cards, and the agent thereof was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to hold herself prepared to descant eloquently
on their beauties. Thus, through the whole
stock in trade.</p>

<p>As for the "nuisance" part, of course it
would be a good deal of a nuisance, and a
good deal of a cross; especially when they
met with surly people who did not even
know how to <i>refuse</i> politely. But as workers
enlisted for the war, they were to be ready
to bear such crosses, always endeavoring to
carry on their work on strictly business
principles; to descend to no urging or
unlady-like pressure, but simply to courteously
offer their goods at honest prices; if, after
such effort, they received replies that were
hard to bear, they must just bear them for
the sake of the cause. Thus decreed the
heroic leader; adding, by way of emphasis,
that all ways of earning money had their
unpleasant side she supposed, and all workers
had moments in which their work could
only be looked upon in the light of a cross.
<i>Would</i> those girls ever know what a cross
it had been to her, Claire Benedict, to come
to South Plains and teach them music?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
This part she <i>thought</i>. Such crosses were
not to be brought out to be talked about.
Hers was connected with such a heavy one,
that it would bear mentioning only to Him
who "carried her sorrows."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"WHY are not the Ansted girls included
among our workers?"</div>

<p>It was the music-teacher who asked this
question, as she waited in the music-room
for recess to close, and her work to begin.
Around the stove gathered the usual group
of girls, talking eagerly. An absorbing topic
had been opened before them, one with
unending resources. Ruth Jennings had had
unprecedented success, the Saturday before,
disposing of pie-lifters. She was detailing
some of her curious experiences. Also she
had received an order for a certain kind of
egg-beater, the like of which had never been
seen in South Plains. She had duly reported
the mysteriously-described thing to Miss
Benedict, who had at once recognized it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and sent her order out by the morning
mail&mdash;not for one, but two dozen. Why
should not other families in South Plains
beat eggs in comfort? It was strange that
she had not thought of those nice little egg-beaters.</p>

<p>This and a dozen other matters of interest
were being repeated and discussed, the
lady at the piano being constantly appealed
to for information, or to confirm some surprising
statement. During a momentary lull
in the talk, she asked her question.</p>

<p>Ruth Jennings answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, the Ansted girls! Why, Miss Benedict,
is it possible that you have not discovered
that they belong to a higher sphere?
Dear me! They have nothing to do with
South Plains, except to tolerate it during a
few months of the summer because the old
homestead is here, and they can't very well
move it to the city. They live in that
lovely place at the top of Curve Hill. You
have been up there, haven't you? It is the
only really lovely spot in South Plains. In
summer their grounds are just elegant!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, Miss Benedict had been in that direction,
and every other. She rested herself,
body and soul, by long, brisk, lonely
walks. She had noticed the place and wondered
over it, and had meant to ask its
history. So unlike every other spot in the
withered village. Great broad fields stretching
into the distance; handsome iron fence,
with massive gate-posts, guarded by fierce-looking
dogs in iron; a trellised arbor, the
outline of a croquet-ground; a hint of wide-spreading,
carefully kept lawns, showing
between patches of the snow; a summerhouse
that in the season of vines and blossoms
must be lovely; a circle that suggested
an artificial pond, centred with a fountain,
where she could imagine the water playing
rainbows with the sunshine in the long
summer days.</p>

<p>And in short, there were all about this
place very unmistakable tokens of the sort of
refinement which is only to be secured by
a full purse and an abundance of elegant
leisure on the part of some one whose tastes
are cultured to the highest degree. Shrouded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in the snows of midwinter, with a shut-up
look about the large, old-fashioned, roomy
house, kept in a state of perfect repair, yet
kept carefully for what it was, a country
home, the place was marked and exceptional.</p>

<p>It spoke a language that could be found
nowhere else, in the village or out of it for
miles around. Miss Benedict had looked
upon it with loving eyes. It spoke to her
of the world from which she had come away;
of the sort of life which had always heretofore
been hers. It did not look elegant to
her, except by contrast with the surrounding
shabbiness. She had been used to much
greater elegance. It simply said "home" to
her sad heart; and only the Saturday before,
she had wondered whose home it was, and
why she never saw people who seemed to
match it, and when it would be opened again
for residence, and whether she should ever
get a chance to visit that lovely greenhouse,
all aglow even now.</p>

<p>It came to her as a surprise that it really
was the home of two of her pupils.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that the Ansteds <i>live</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
there?" she questioned. "Where is the family?
and why are the girls here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the family are everywhere. They
scatter in the winter like the birds. Go
South, you know, or West, or wherever suits
their royal fancy. They have no home but
this, because they can not make up their
minds where to settle down for one, so they
board all over the world. Do business in
the city, live in South Plains, and stay in
Europe; that is about their history."</p>

<p>"And the girls remain here while their
parents are away?"</p>

<p>"Part of the time, yes'm. Mrs. Ansted was
a schoolmate of Mrs. Foster, I have heard,
and respects her very highly, and would prefer
having the girls with her to sending
them anywhere else. Mr. Ansted is a merchant
in the city. In the summer he comes
out home every night, and some of them
stay in town with him a great deal. It is
only ten miles away, you know. If they did
not charge so dreadfully on the new railroad,
we might get a chance to look at its
splendors once in a while ourselves; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Ansteds don't care for high prices. Mr.
Ansted is one of the directors, and I suppose
they ride for nothing, just because they
could afford to pay eighty cents a day as
well as not. That seems to be the way
things work."</p>

<p>"But the family attend this church, of
course, while they are here. I should think
the girls would be interested to join us."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, ma'am; indeed, they don't. They
haven't been inside the church six times in
as many years. They go to town."</p>

<p>"Not to church!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm; they do. Every pleasant day their
carriage rolls by our house about half-past
eight, and makes me feel cross and envious
all day."</p>

<p>"But do you really mean that they habitually
go ten miles to church each Sabbath,
when there is one right at their doors that
they might attend? What denomination are
they?"</p>

<p>"The very same as our own," the girl
said, laughing over Miss Benedict's astonished
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the gentle Nettie added her explanation:</p>

<p>"Well, but, girls, you know they don't
really go <i>ten</i> miles. There is an elegant
church, Miss Benedict, just about seven, or
maybe almost eight, miles from here. It was
built by wealthy people who live out there
in the suburbs, and it is said to be the
prettiest church in town, and the Ansteds go
to that."</p>

<p>"But eight miles every Sabbath, and return,
must make a busy and wearying day
of the Sabbath, I should think, when there
is no occasion. How came they to fall into
the habit of going so far?"</p>

<p>"Why, they did not use to spend their
summers here; only a few weeks during
August. They had a house in town, and
then Mrs. Ansted was sick, and the doctors
said she could not live in the city, and
they had a little delicate baby, who they
said would die unless they kept it in the
country. So, they sold their town house,
and came out here to stay until they decided
what to do, and then the railroad was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
built, and Mr. Ansted found it easy enough
to get back and forth to his business, and
the baby began to grow strong, and they
spent a great deal of money on the place,
and grew to liking it, and they just stay on.
They keep rooms in town, and are there a
great deal, but they really live in South
Plains."</p>

<p>"And drive to church every Sabbath!"</p>

<p>"Well, every Sabbath when it is pleasant.
They are not very regular. When it is too
warm to go, they lounge under the trees,
and when it is too rainy they lounge in
their handsome house, I suppose. At any rate,
they don't appear in our church. We don't
see much more of them when they are at
home than when they are in Europe, only
riding by."</p>

<p>"And do the girls like to be here at
school while the family is away?"</p>

<p>"Well, that is a new thing, you see.
Mrs. Foster has only been here since September.
Before that, they never looked at
our school; but directly they heard she was
coming, the Ansted girls came in, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to board here until the family come back
from Florida. We never any of us spoke to
Fannie and Ella Ansted in our lives until
they appeared here in October."</p>

<p>Then Mary Burton spoke:</p>

<p>"And we shall not get a chance to speak
with their highnesses much longer. The Ansteds
are coming home in two weeks. Lilian,
that's the baby, has had a low fever, and
the doctors have decided that she needs to
come home and get braced up, and the
house is being aired for their coming. Ella
Ansted told me this morning. She says she
and Fannie will only be here at recitations
after next week or week after. She doesn't
know just when the folks will get here,
they are going to stop in New York."</p>

<p>"Girls," said the music-teacher in her most
resolute tone, "let us get the Ansted girls
into our circle, and set them at work for
the church."</p>

<p>But this met with eager demurs. The
Ansteds held themselves aloof from South
Plains. They never made calls among the
people, or invited them to their home, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
noticed them in any way. They had nothing
to do with the poor little church; never
came to the prayer meetings, nor to the
socials, nor in any way indicated that they
belonged to the same flesh and blood as the
worshipers there, and South Plains held its
head too high and thought too much of
itself to run after them. The girls were well
enough, Fannie and Ella, and they had
been pleasant to them; but as for stooping
to coax them to help, they did not feel that
they could do it, even for Miss Benedict.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to stoop," declared
Miss Benedict, "nor to coax. I want you
to give them a good hearty invitation to
join us. Poor things! I am just as sorry
for them as I can be! Eight miles away
from their church and all church friends;
no prayer meeting to attend, and no pastor
to interest himself in all they do! I have
wondered why those girls seemed so out in
the cold. I begin to understand it. You
think you have been cordial; but you have
just edged out a little, made a tiny opening
in your circle, and said in effect: 'Oh, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
may come in, if you will crawl in there!
We will tolerate you while you are here,
if you won't expect too much, nor ask us
to invite you to our special doings of any
sort. You are just outsiders, and we are
not going to stoop to you, and let you be
one with us.'"</p>

<p>The girls laughed a little, but Ruth Jennings
demurred. Nobody had wanted them
to stay outside; they had chosen to do so.
They would not attend the church, though
the trustees had invited Mr. Ansted, and
they never showed in any way an interest
in South Plains or its people.</p>

<p>Miss Benedict changed her tactics:</p>

<p>"Girls, wait; let me ask you, are Fannie
and Ella Ansted Christians?"</p>

<p>"Not that I ever heard of," Ruth said,
and Mary Burton added that she knew they
were not; that one day when they were
talking about such things, Ella asked the
strangest questions, almost as though she
were a heathen; and Fannie did not seem
to know much better.</p>

<p>"Well, have you made them realize that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
you young people belong to Christ, and that
it is a pleasant way, and you would like
to have them join it, and work for his
cause? Ruth, my dear, do they know that
you desire to have them happy in Christ,
and that you pray for this every day?"</p>

<p>"It isn't likely they do, Miss Benedict,
for it isn't true. I never thought about
them twice in my life in that connection,
and I know I never prayed for them."</p>

<p>"And are there any of you who can give
a better record than that?" She looked
around upon the silenced group, and waited
in vain for an answer. At last she said,
gently:</p>

<p>"Now, girls, there are only two questions
more that I want to ask you. One is:
Which is it that stands aloof, and makes
no effort to help others, you or the Ansted
girls, if you know Christ and they do not?
And the other is: Will you all agree to
invite them to join us, and do it heartily?"</p>

<p>The pealing bell cut short an answer, if
one had been intended. Miss Benedict was
glad. She wanted no answer just then;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
she had planted her little seed, and hoped
that it would take root and grow.</p>

<p>"She has a way of taking things for
granted," said one of the group which moved
out of the music-room, leaving Nettie to
take her lesson. "How does she know that
any of us are Christians?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, then Mary
Burton asked:</p>

<p>"Do you really suppose there is no difference
between us and others? Can't we
be told in any way?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know how. There
hasn't been a communion service since she
came here, and we don't any of us go to
prayer meeting. They say she does. Father
said she sat in one corner of that dark old
church the other night; the first woman
there, and not many came afterward."</p>

<p>Said Mary Burton:</p>

<p>"I wonder what it means, any way, to
come out from among them and be separate?
I came across that verse in my reading the
other night, and I wondered, then, just
what it meant. We girls are certainly not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
any more 'separate' since we joined the
church than we were before, so far as I
know; and yet the verse some way made
me think of Miss Benedict; she seems different
from other Christians. I should like
to know just what made the difference?"</p>

<p>"She is 'gooder,'" said Ruth Jennings,
laughing a little, "that is just the whole of
it; but I wish she hadn't started out on
this idea about the Ansteds. They won't
join us, and I don't want to feel myself
humiliated by asking them."</p>

<p>But Nettie, usually easy to be turned
aside, held persistently to the thought which
troubled her.</p>

<p>"I know she is 'gooder,' that is what
I say; but ought not we to be the same?
Ought the boys and girls with whom we
five spend so much time, to feel that we
just belong to their set, and are in no sense
different from them? We are all the church-members
there are among the young people,
you know. When I told Miss Benedict that
the other day, she looked astonished for a
minute, and then she said: 'You dear girls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
what a work you have to do!' But I don't
feel as though we were doing it, and I, for
one, don't know how; but I wish I did."</p>

<p>There was no answer to that. The little
seed was taking root, though not in the way
that the planter had planned.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>AN OPEN DOOR.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THEREAFTER Miss Benedict thought
much about the Ansteds. She herself
could hardly have told why they interested
her so much, though she attributed it to
the fact that the surroundings of the old
house spoke to her of home. The family returned
and established themselves there, and
the blinds were thrown open, and through the
half-drawn shades, as she took her after-school
walks, she could see glimpses of
bright, beautiful life inside; she longed to
get nearer, and saw no way to accomplish it.</div>

<p>The Ansted girls had been invited to join
the workers. Miss Benedict's influence reached
as far as this, though that lady wished she
had been sure that the invitation had
sounded cordial and hearty. But they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hesitated and hesitated, and proposed to talk
with mamma about it, and mamma was reported
to have said that it was hardly worth
while; they were such entire strangers to
the church and the people that of course
they could not be expected to have the interest
in it which others had; and the
girls had tossed their heads and said they
knew it would be just so, they were sorry
they had invited them, and they would not
be caught that way again, not even for
Miss Benedict.</p>

<p>Meantime, Miss Benedict studied the
Ansteds from a distance, and tried to understand
the reasons for their utter isolation
from the good people of the village.
She cultivated the friendship of the two
girls who were her pupils, and who, now
that they had declined the invitation to
join the others, were more shut off from
them than before. Miss Benedict took care,
however, not to refer to this episode; there
were reasons why she did not desire to
know the particulars. But she made herself
as winning as she could to the girls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
wondered how and when she could reach
their home.</p>

<p>As is often the case, the way opened unexpectedly.</p>

<p>It was a wintry evening, and she, having
walked further than she had intended, was
making the return trip with all speed, lest
the darkness fast closing on the village,
should envelop her before she reached the
academy.</p>

<p>"How foolish I was," she told herself, "to
go so far! I must have walked two miles,
and it is beginning to snow. What would
mamma think to see me on the dark street
alone?"</p>

<p>In common with most city-bred ladies,
accustomed to treading the brightly-lighted
city streets with indifference, she looked
upon the darkness and silence of the country
with a sort of terror, and was making
swift strides, not pausing even to get the
glimpse of "home" which shone out broadly
across the snow from all the front windows
of the house on Curve Hill.</p>

<p>It looked very home-like, but her only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
home was that plain, little upper room, at
the academy, and thither she must go with
all speed. Underneath the freshly-falling
snow lay a treacherous block of ice, and as
the hurrying feet touched it, they slipped
from their owner's control, and she was
lying a limp heap at the foot of Curve
Hill.</p>

<p>No use to try to rise and hasten on. A
very slight effort in that direction told her
that one ankle was useless. What was to be
done? She looked up and down the street;
not a person was to be seen in either direction.
Would it be of any use to call through
this rising wind for assistance? How plainly
she could see the forms flitting about that
bright room! yet they might as well be
miles away, so far as her power to reach
them was concerned. She made a second
effort to rise, and fell back with a groan;
it was best not to attempt that again, or
she should faint, and certainly she had
need of her senses now. If only one of
those queer-looking wood-sleighs, over which
she had laughed only this afternoon, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
come along and pick her up, how grateful
she would be! Somebody else was coming
to pick her up.</p>

<p>"What have we here?" said a brisk voice.
"Fallen humanity? plenty of that to be
found. What is the immediate cause?"
Then in a lower tone: "I believe it is a woman!"
By this time he had reached her
side, a young man, prepared to make merry
over the fallen fortunes of some child; so
he had evidently at first supposed.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, ma'am," he said, and even
at that moment he waited to lift his hat,
"did you fall? Are you injured? How can
I best help you?"</p>

<p>Claire Benedict of old had one peculiarity
which had often vexed her more nervous
young sister: under embarrassing or trying
circumstances of any sort, where the average
young woman would be likely to cry, she
was nearly certain to laugh. It was just
what she did at this moment.</p>

<p>"I think I have sprained my ankle," she
said between her laughs; "at least, it will
not allow me to move without growing faint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
so I am keeping still; I thought I needed
my senses just now. If you can think of
any way of securing a wagon of some sort
in which I can ride to the academy, it will
help me materially."</p>

<p>"To the academy! Why, that is a mile
away! You must take a shorter ride than that
for the first one. You can not be very heavy,
I should say. Allow me." And before she
understood what he was planning sufficiently
to attempt a protest, he had stooped and unceremoniously
picked her up, and was taking
swift strides across the snow-covered lawn
to the side piazza of the Ansted house.
The gate leading to the carriage-drive was
thrown open, so there had been no obstacle
in his way.</p>

<p>It was ridiculous to laugh under such circumstances,
but this was just what Claire
did, while her porter threw open the door,
strode through the wide hall, and dropped
her among the cushions of a luxurious couch,
in one of the bright rooms.</p>

<p>"Here is a maimed lady," he said. "Mamma,
Alice, where are some of you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Louis!" said a familiar voice, "what's
the matter? Did you run over her? Why,
Fannie, it is Miss Benedict! Mamma! Louis,
call mamma, quick!"</p>

<p>And then Claire really accomplished what
she had so often threatened, and fainted entirely
away.</p>

<p>"It is only a sprain," she explained, directly
her eyes were open again; "I was
very foolish to faint."</p>

<p>A pleasant, motherly face was bending
over her, with eyes like Ella and hair like
Fannie; this must be the mother.</p>

<p>"Is it a sprain, do you think?" she asked,
"or only a sort of twist? Those things are
sometimes very painful for awhile. We have
sent for a physician, and shall soon know
what to do for you. In the meantime,
Fannie, my dear, her boot should be removed."</p>

<p>Thus reminded, Fannie bent with eager
fingers over the injured member.</p>

<p>"Did you fall, Miss Benedict? Wasn't it
too bad? But since you were going to fall,
I am glad you did it right by our gate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma, do you know? This is our
music-teacher."</p>

<p>"So I judged, daughter. We are sorry to
make her acquaintance in this manner, and
glad to be of service. Bring another pillow,
Ella."</p>

<p>It was all gracefully and graciously said.
Mrs. Ansted was not a woman who would
have thought of seeking out, and calling in
a friendly way on her daughter's music-teacher;
but she was one who, when that
music-teacher appeared at her door in need
of assistance, could bestow it heartily and
delicately.</p>

<p>"She is not like mamma in the least&mdash;oh,
not in any particular&mdash;and yet I think
she means to be a good woman, so far as
she sees the way to it out of the environments
of her world. I wonder if there is
any way in which I am to help her, and if
this is a beginning?"</p>

<p>This was the mental comment of the music-teacher,
who was supposed to be absorbed in
her own troubles.</p>

<p>It all arranged itself speedily and naturally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
The doctor came and pronounced the ankle
badly sprained, advised entire quiet for a few
days, heartily seconded Mrs. Ansted's suggestion
that the prisoner should remain with
them, and when Claire faintly demurred, that
lady said, decidedly:</p>

<p>"Why, of course, it will be the proper
thing to do. It is not as though you were
at home. The academy is at best, a poor
place in which to secure quiet, and there is
no occasion for submitting to the discomfort
of getting there. This is decidedly the place
for you. Since it was the treacherous ice
on our walk that brought you to grief, you
must allow us to make what amends we
can. I will send word to Mrs. Foster at
once."</p>

<p>Claire yielded gracefully; in truth, she was
rather anxious to do so. She was interested
in the Ansteds. She had been wondering how
she could make their acquaintance, and interest
them in matters that she believed required
their aid. She had been doing more
than wondering. Only this morning, thinking
of the subject, as she locked her door for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
prayer, she had carried it to Christ, and
asked him for opportunities, if indeed he
meant that she was to work in this direction.
What a signal opportunity! Certainly not of
her planning. She must take care how she
closed the door on it. Behold her, then, an
hour later, domiciled in one of the guest
chambers of the beautiful old home, where
every touch of taste and refinement, yes, and
luxury, soothed her heart like a breath from
home. This was the home to which she had
heretofore been accustomed. More elegant
her own had been, it is true, but the same
disregard to money that had characterized
the belongings of her father's house were
apparent here; everything spoke of a full
purse and a cultured taste. It was very
foolish, but Claire could not help a little
sigh of satisfaction over the delicacy of the
curtains and the fineness of the bed draperies.
Had she really missed things of that sort so
much? she asked herself. Yes, she had!
her truthful heart responded. She liked all
soft and fair and pretty things; but, after
all, the main reason for their soothing influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
now was that they said "home" and
"mother" to her.</p>

<p>Laid aside thus suddenly from her regular
line of work, the morning found her, dressed,
and lying on the fawn-colored couch in her
pretty room, considering what there was to
do that day. She had already feasted royally;
the delicate breakfast that had been sent up
to her was served on rare old china, and
accompanied with the finest of damask and
the brightest of solid silver.</p>

<p>They commented on her in the dining-room
below after this fashion:</p>

<p>"Poor creature, I suppose she thinks she
has dropped into fairy-land. She looks as
though she could appreciate the little refinements
of life. I quite enjoyed sending her
that quaint old cream cup. I fancy she has
taste enough to admire it." This from the
mother. Then Alice:</p>

<p>"Mamma, are not such things a sort of
cruel kindness? Think of going back to the
thick dishes and cheap knives of the academy
after being served in state for a few days!"</p>

<p>"I know, dear; but we can not help that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
part. She will probably not remain long
enough to get spoiled. She is really quite
interesting. I wonder if she has seen better
days?"</p>

<p>How would Claire have answered this question?
"Fairyland?" yes, it was something
of that to her, but she was like a fairy who
had been astray in a new world, and had
reached home again. The silver might be
choice, but she had seen as choice, and the
china might have been handed down for
generations, yet the style of it and the feel
of it were quite familiar to her. Dainty and
delicate things had been every-day matters in
her father's house. "Different" days she had
seen, oh, very different; yet this young girl,
so suddenly stranded on what looked like a
rough shore, was already beginning to question
whether, after all, these were not her
"better days." Had she ever before leaned
her heart on Christ as she was learning now
to do? Busy in his cause she had always
been, eagerly busy, ever since she could remember;
but she began to have a dim feeling
that it was one thing to be busy in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
cause, and quite another to walk with him,
saying, as a child, "What next?" and taking
up the "next" with a happy unquestioning
as to the right of it. Something of
this new experience was beginning to steal
over her; there seemed to be less of Claire
Benedict than ever before, but there was in
her place one who was growing willing to be
led, and Claire already felt that she would
not be willing to take back the old Claire
Benedict; she was growing attached to this
new one.</p>

<p>Before that day closed, the Ansteds had a
revelation.</p>

<p>It was Alice, the young lady daughter of
the house, who had come up to show Mrs.
Foster the way, and who lingered and chatted
with the cheerful young prisoner after Mrs.
Foster had taken her departure. She stooped
for Claire's handkerchief, which had dropped,
and said, as her eye fell on the name:</p>

<p>"I know of a young lady who has your
full name. That is singular, is it not? The
name is not a common one."</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Claire, interested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
"Is she nice? Shall I immediately claim relationship?"</p>

<p>"I am not in the least acquainted with
her, though I fancy from what I have heard
that she may be very 'nice.' She was pointed
out to me once at a concert in Boston, by
a gentleman who had some acquaintance with
her. She is the daughter of Sidney L. Benedict,
a millionnaire. I suppose you do not
know of her, though she is a namesake. I
heard more about her father perhaps than I
did of her. Ever so many people seemed to
admire him as a wonderful man; very benevolent,
you know, and sort of hopelessly
good, he seemed to me. I remember telling
my brother Louis that it must be rather
oppressive to have such a reputation for
goodness to sustain. Were you ever in Boston?"</p>

<p>The music-teacher was so long in answering,
that Miss Alice turned toward her
questioningly, and found that the eyes, but
a moment, before so bright, were brimming
with tears.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she said, sympathetically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
"does your ankle pain you so badly?
Something ought to be done for it. I will
call mamma."</p>

<p>But Claire's hand detained her.</p>

<p>"It is not that," she said gently, and
smiled. "I forgot my ankle, and where I was,
and everything. He was a good man, Miss
Ansted; good and true to the heart's core,
and his goodness was not oppressive, it was
his joy. He has gone now to wear his
crown, and I am proud to be his daughter
Claire. But oh, there are times when the
longing to see him rolls over me so that
it swallows every other thought." And then
the poor little teacher buried her head in
the lace-trimmed pillows and cried outright!</p>

<p>"Mamma, what do you think! Louis, can
you believe it possible? She is one of the
Boston Benedicts! A daughter of that Sidney
L. about whom we heard so much when
we were with the Maitlands!"</p>

<p>"I heard he had gone to smash!" said
Louis, when the first astonishment was over,
"but I thought he had done it fashionably,
and provided handsomely for his family."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>A "FANATIC."</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>I&nbsp;&nbsp;DO not suppose people realize how much
such things influence them. For instance,
Alice Ansted was the sort of girl who would
have been ashamed of herself had she realized
how much more important a person
Claire Benedict was to her as soon as it
became known that she belonged to the Boston
Benedicts. But the fact was very apparent
to others, if not to Alice. She had been
very glad, before this, to have Miss Benedict
enjoy the comforts of the house, but
now she hovered about her, and gave her
crumbs of personal attention, and found a
fascination in hearing her talk, and, in short,
was interested in her to a degree that she
could never have been simply in the poor
music-teacher.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>She brought her work one morning, and
sat by the luxurious chair where Claire had
been imprisoned, with her injured foot skillfully
arranged on a hassock.</p>

<p>"How pretty it is," Claire said, watching
the crimson silk flowers grow on the canvas
under skillful fingers; "do you enjoy working
on it?"</p>

<p>The tone of voice which answered her was
dissatisfied in the extreme:</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so; as well as I enjoy
anything that there is to do. One must employ
one's self in some way, and we live such
a humdrum life here that there is chance
for very little variety. I am puzzled to know
how you manage it, Miss Benedict; you have
been accustomed to such different surroundings.
This is a sharp enough contrast to
Chester. Have you been in Chester yet, Miss
Benedict? Well, it is just a nice little city;
hardly large enough to be called a city.
The society is good, and there is always
something going on, and when I come out
here I am at an utter loss what to do with
myself. But then, Chester is very far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
being Boston, and if I had had the advantages
of Boston all my life, as you have, I
feel sure I could not endure a month of South
Plains. It is bad enough for me. How do
you bear it?"</p>

<p>Claire could only smile in answer to this.
There were circumstances connected with her
removal from Boston which were too keenly
felt to touch with a careless hand. She
hastened to ask questions.</p>

<p>"What is there pleasant in Chester? I
have promised myself to go there some
Saturday, and see what I can find in the
library."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is a very fair library there, I
believe, for a town of its size, but I never
patronize it; we have books enough. By
the way, Miss Benedict, you are welcome to
the use of our library. Papa will be glad
to have some one enjoying the books. The
girls have as much as they can endure of
books in school, and Louis is not literary in
his tastes; I am almost the only reader.
Mamma is so busy with various city benevolences
that, what with her housekeeping and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
social cares, she rarely has time for much
reading. Oh, Chester is well enough. There
are concerts, you know, and lectures, or entertainments
of some sort; one can keep
busy there, if one accepts invitations. But,
to tell you the truth, the whole thing often
bores me beyond endurance, and I am glad
to get out here to be away from it all. I
don't like my life. I think I have talents
for something better, if one could only find
what it is&mdash;the something better, I mean."</p>

<p>There was a pretty flush on her discontented
face as she looked up eagerly to see
how this confidence was being received. Claire's
face was gently sympathetic, and grave. Alice
took courage.</p>

<p>"Mamma laughs at me, and says I am
visionary, and that I want to have a career,
and that I must be content to fill my sphere
in life, as my ancestors have done before
me; but really I am not content. I don't
like the sort of life spread out before me
for generations back; marrying, you know,
and keeping up a handsome house, and receiving
and paying visits, and giving a grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
party once a year, when you are sure to
offend somebody to whom you were indebted
in some way, and whom you forgot. Now,
do you see any particular enjoyment in that
sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"No," said Claire unhesitatingly, "I do
not."</p>

<p>"I'm real glad to hear you say so. Mamma
thinks it is dreadful to be discontented
with one's lot; but I am. I would like a
career of some sort; anything that would
absorb me. And yet I don't want to be
poor. I should shrink from that. Do you
really find it easier to get along with life,
now that you have not time to think, as
you used?"</p>

<p>Another question to be gently put aside.
What did this girl know of the charmed
life which she had lived at home, and of
the father who had been its centre? She
could not go into the depths of her heart
and drag out its memories, unless there were
a very grave reason for so doing.</p>

<p>"I have always lived a very busy life,"
she answered, evasively; "but before I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
help you with any of my experiences, I
must ask one question: Are you not a Christian,
Miss Ansted?"</p>

<p>Apparently it was an amazing question to
the young girl. Her cheeks took a deeper
flush; she let her canvas half drop from
her hand, and fixed inquiring eyes on her
questioner.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; that is, I suppose I am, or
hope I am, or something; I am a member
of the church, if that is what you mean."</p>

<p>"It is not in the least what I mean.
That is only the outward sign&mdash;worthless, if
it is not indeed a sign of union with Christ.
Such a union as furnishes a career, Miss
Ansted, which alone is worthy of you. Such
a union as carries you captive&mdash;making your
time and your money, and your talents, not
your own, but his. There is nothing dissatisfying
about such a life, my friend. It
almost lifts one above the accident of outward
surroundings."</p>

<p>There was an undoubted amazement expressed
on Miss Ansted's face now.</p>

<p>"I don't in the least understand you,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
she said. "What has my being a member
of the church to do with all this time which
lies on my hands just now, I should like to
know. If you mean mission bands and benevolent
societies, and all that sort of thing,
my tastes don't lie in that direction, in the
least. Mamma does enough of that for the
entire family; she always has some poky
board meeting to attend. I have sat shivering
in the carriage, and waited for her last
words so many times, that I am utterly sick
of the whole thing. Oh, I am a member,
of course, and give money; that is all they
want. But you are mistaken in supposing
that these things help me in the least."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Claire said, unable to
help smiling over the darkness which had so
misunderstood and misinterpreted Christian
work, and yet feeling that it called for tears
rather than smiles; "these things are only
more of the 'outward signs.'"</p>

<p>They were interrupted then, and Claire
was not sorry. She wanted to think over
her ground. There was no use in casting
these pearls of truth before Alice Ansted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
she was too utterly in the dark to see them.
A young lady she was, well educated, in the
common acceptation of that term, accomplished,
so far as music and French were
concerned, skillful as regards embroidery and
worsted work; but evidently the veriest child
as regarded the Christian life, though she
had been a member of the visible church
for years. If she were to be helped at all,
Claire must come down from the heights
where she walked and meet her on some
common ground.</p>

<p>"I wonder how the old church would do?"
she asked herself. "I wish I could get her
interested in it, both for her sake and for
the sake of the church."</p>

<p>Had she heard the report given below of
this brief conversation, she might have been
discouraged, for she was but a young worker
after all, and had not met with many rebuffs.</p>

<p>"Mamma, she is a regular little fanatic,"
so Alice affirmed. "You ought to have
heard her talk to me! It sounded just like
quotations from that old book of sermons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that grandma used to pore over. I didn't
know what she meant."</p>

<p>"Probably she did not either," was the
comment of this Christian mother. "Some
very young people occasionally fall into that
style, talking heroics, using theological terms
of which they can not grasp the meaning,
and fancy it a higher type of religion. She
will probably know both less and more as
she grows older."</p>

<p>Then was Miss Benedict's pupil, Ella, emboldened
to come to the rescue of her
teacher's reputation:</p>

<p>"But, mamma, she is not so very young.
I saw her birthday book, and the date made
her twenty in September."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mrs. Ansted, with amused
smile, "that is quite a patriarchal age. She
certainly ought to be well posted in all
theological dogmas by this time. My dear,
it is one of the worst ages for a young
woman&mdash;if she isn't absorbed with an engagement
by that time to fancy herself superior."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma! you don't know Miss Benedict.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
She doesn't fancy herself superior to
anybody. She is just as sweet and lovely
as she can be. All the girls like her, and
I think she has the nicest religion of anybody
I know!" This outburst was from
Fannie.</p>

<p>"Very well, dear," answered the mother
complacently; "admire her as much as you
like. She is quite as safe a shrine as any
for a young girl like you to worship at.
You must always have some one. I am
glad the girls like her, poor thing; her life
must be doleful enough at best. It is certainly
a great change." And the benevolent
mother sighed in sympathy. She was glad
to be able to put what she thought was a
little sunshine from her elegant home into
the poor music-teacher's lot. She even wondered,
as she waited for her carriage to drive
down town, whether the sprained ankle were
not a providential arrangement to enable her
to give a few days of rest and luxury to
this unfortunate girl.</p>

<p>This thought she kept quite to herself.
She did not quite accept such strained and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
peculiar views of Providence. It savored a
little of fanaticism&mdash;a thing which she
disapproved, and Mr. Ansted disliked; but
then, some people thought such things, and
it was barely possible that they were sometimes
correct.</p>

<p>She went out to her carriage still thinking
these thoughts, and Claire, watching
her from the upper window, said to herself:</p>

<p>"I wonder if I can help her? I wonder
if God means me to? Of course, I am set
down here for something." <i>She</i> had no
doubt at all about the providence in it.</p>

<p>The son of the house had added one
sentence to the family discussion:</p>

<p>"You might have known that she would
be a fanatic, after you found that she was
Sydney Benedict's daughter. He was the
wildest kind of a visionary. Porter was
talking about him to-day. He knew them
in Boston. He says Benedict gave away
enough every year to support his family in
splendid style. They are reaping the results
of his extravagance."</p>

<p>This is only one of the many different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ways which there are of looking at things.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the fair fanatic seemed to be
an attractive object to the entire family.
Louis, not hitherto particularly fond of
evenings at home, found himself lingering
in the up-stairs library, whither he had
himself wheeled the large chair with the
patient seated therein. As the days passed,
she persisted in making herself useful, and
Ella and Fannie, under her daily tuition,
were making very marked progress in music,
as well as in some other things that their
mother did not understand about so well.
It was on one of these cosey evenings that
Louis occupied the piano-stool, he and Alice
having been performing snatches of favorite
duets, until Alice was summoned to the
parlors.</p>

<p>"Come down, won't you, Louis? that is
a good boy. It is the Powell girls, and
Dick will be with them, I presume." This
had been Alice's petition just as she was
leaving the room.</p>

<p>But Louis had elevated both eyebrows and
shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Powell girls!" he repeated. "Not
if this individual knows himself! I never
inflict myself on the Powell girls, if there
is any possibility of avoiding it; and as for
Dick, I would go a square out of my way
any time, to save boring him. Excuse me,
please, Alice; I am not at home, or I <i>am</i>
at home, and indisposed&mdash;just as you
please; the latter has the merit of truth.
It is my duty to stay here and entertain
Miss Benedict, since the girls have deserted
her.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that you would excuse
me with pleasure, but nevertheless I consider
it my duty to stay!" This last was
merrily added, just as Alice closed the door.</p>

<p>Claire did not wait to reply to the banter,
but plunged at once into the centre of
the thought which had been growing on her
for several days.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ansted, do you know, I wish I could
enlist both you and your sisters as helpers
in the renovation of the old church down
town?"</p>

<p>"What! the old brick rookery on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
corner? My dear young lady, your faith is
sublime, and your knowledge of this precious
village limited! That concern was past renovating
some years before the flood. It was
about that time, or a little later, that my
respected grandfather tried to remodel the
seats, and raised such a storm of indignation
about his ears that it took a century to
calm the people down; so tradition says.
Whatever you undertake to do will be a
failure; I feel it my duty to inform you of so
much. And now I am burning with a desire
to ask a rude question: Why do you care
to do anything with it? Why does it interest
you in the least? I beg your pardon
if I am meddling with what does not concern
me, but I was amused over the affair
when the girls came home and petitioned to
join the charmed circle. Why a lady who
was here but for a passing season or so, should
interest herself in the old horror, was beyond
my comprehension. Is it strictly benevolence,
may I ask?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is benevolence at all. It
is a plain-faced duty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Duty!" The heavy eyebrows were raised
again. "I don't comprehend you. Why should
a stranger to this miserable, little, squeezed-up
village, and one who by all the laws of
association and affinity will surely not spend
much of her time here, have any duties connected
with that old box, which the church
fathers have allowed to run into desolation
and disgrace for so many years, that the
present generation accepts it as a matter of
course?"</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to ask <i>you</i> one question,
Mr. Ansted? Are you a Christian?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>LOGIC AND LABOR.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE young man thus addressed gave
over fingering the piano-keys, as he had
been softly doing from time to time, whirled
about on the music-stool, and indulged in a
prolonged and curious stare at his questioner.</div>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said at last, with
a little laugh, as he recognized the rudeness
of the proceeding; "I am struck dumb, I
think. In all my previous extended experience
no more astonishing query has ever
been put to me. I don't know how to take
it."</p>

<p>"Won't you simply answer it?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is too astonishing to me that
the thing requires an answer! I don't believe
I even know what it is to be the sort
of character to which you refer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, am I to understand that you don't
know but you may be one?"</p>

<p>The young man laughed again, a slightly
embarrassed laugh, and gave his visitor a
swift, penetrating glance, as if he would
like to know whether she was playing a
part; then finding that she waited, he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all! In fact, I may say I
am very certain that I don't belong to the
class in question, even in name."</p>

<p>"May I ask you why?"</p>

<p>"Why!" He repeated the word. There
was something very bewildering and embarrassing
about these short, direct, simply-put
questions. He had never heard them before.
"Really, that is harder to answer than the
first. What is it to be a Christian, Miss
Benedict?"</p>

<p>"It is to love the Lord Jesus Christ with
a love that places his honor and his cause
and his commands first, and all else secondary."</p>

<p>"Who does it?"</p>

<p>"He knows. Perhaps there are many. Why
are not you one?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>He dropped his eyes now, but answered
lightly:</p>

<p>"Hard to tell. I have never given the
matter sufficiently serious thought to be able
to witness in the case."</p>

<p>"But is that reply worthy of a reasoning
being? Won't you be frank about the matter,
Mr. Ansted? I don't mean to preach,
and I did not intend to be offensively personal.
I was thinking this afternoon how
strange it was that so many well-educated,
reasoning young men left this subject outside,
and were apparently indifferent to it, though
they professed to believe in the story of the
Bible; and I wondered why it was: what
process of reasoning brought them to such a
position. Will you tell me about it? How
do young men, who are intelligent, who accept
the Bible as a standard of morals by
which the world ought to be governed, who
respect the church and think it ought to be
supported, reason about their individual positions
as outsiders? They do not stand outside
of political questions where they have
a settled opinion; why do they in this?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered at last.
"The majority of them, perhaps, never give
it a thought; with others the claims which
the church makes are too squarely in contact
with pre-arranged plans of life; and
none of them more than half believe in religion
as exhibited in the every-day lives
about them."</p>

<p>"Have you given me your reason for being
outside, Mr. Ansted?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I suppose so; that is, so far
as I can be said to have a reason. I don't
reason about these matters."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me which one of the three
reasons you gave is yours?"</p>

<p>"Were you educated for the bar, Miss
Benedict? Since you press me, I must say
that a mixture of all three might be found
revolving about my inner consciousness. I
rarely trouble myself with the subject. That
is foolish. I suppose; but it is really no
more foolish than I am about many things.
Then so far as I may be said to have plans,
what little I know of the Bible is dreadfully
opposed to the most of them, and, well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
I don't more than one third believe in any
of the professions which are being lived
about me."</p>

<p>"But you believe in the Bible?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I believe it is a fine old book, which
has some grand reading in it, and some that
is very dull, and I know as little about it
as the majority of men and women."</p>

<p>"Oh, then let me put the question a little
differently: Do you believe in Jesus
Christ?"</p>

<p>"Believe in him!"</p>

<p>"Yes, as one who once lived in person on
this earth, and died on a cross, and went
back to heaven, and is to come again at
some future time?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I have no particular reason for
doubting prophecy or history on those points.
I'm rather inclined to think the whole story
is true."</p>

<p>"Do you think his character worthy of
admiration?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course; it is a remarkable
character. Even infidels concede that, you
know; and I am no infidel. Bob Ingersoll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and his follies have no charm for me. I
have had that disease, Miss Benedict; like
the measles and whooping-cough, it belongs
to a certain period of life, you know, and I
am past that. I had it in a very mild form,
however, and it left no trace. The fellow's
logic has nothing to stand on."</p>

<p>She ignored the entire sentence, save the
first two words. She had not the slightest
desire to talk about Bob Ingersoll, or to let
this gay young man explain some of Bob's
weak mistakes, and laugh with her over his
want of historic knowledge. She went straight
to the centre of the subject:</p>

<p>"Then, Mr Ansted, won't you join his
army, and come over and help us?"</p>

<p>Nothing had ever struck the brilliant young
man as being more embarrassing than this
simple question, with a pair of earnest eyes
waiting for his answer. It would not do to
be merrily stupid and pretend to misunderstand
her question, as he at first meditated,
and ask her whether she really wanted him
to join Ingersoll's army. Her grave eyes
were fixed on his face too searchingly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that. There was nothing for it but to flit
behind one of his flimsy reasons:</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Benedict, there are already
enough recruits of the sort that I should
make. When I find a Christian man whom
I can admire with all my heart&mdash;instead of
seeing things in him every day that even I,
with my limited knowledge, know to be contrary
to his orders&mdash;I may perhaps give the
matter consideration, but, in my opinion,
the army is too large now."</p>

<p>"But you told me you admired Jesus
Christ. I do not ask you to be like any
other person&mdash;to act in any sense like any
other person whom you ever saw or of whom
you ever heard. Will you copy him, Mr.
Ansted?"</p>

<p>There was no help for it; there must be a
direct answer; she was waiting.</p>

<p>"I do not suppose I will." This was his
reply, but the air of gayety with which he
had been speaking was gone. You might
almost have imagined that he was ashamed
of the words.</p>

<p>"Won't you please tell me why?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Was there ever a man under such a direct
fire of personal questions hard to answer?
Banter would not do. There was
something in the face and voice of the
questioner which made him feel that it would
be a personal insult to reply other than
seriously.</p>

<p>"There are insurmountable difficulties in
the way," he said at last, speaking in a low,
grave tone.</p>

<p>"Difficulties too hard for God to surmount?
You can not mean that?"</p>

<p>But he did not explain what he meant,
and at that moment he received a peremptory
summons from his mother to the parlor.
He arose at once, glad, apparently, of the
interruption, but did not attempt to return
to the free and easy tone with which he had
carried on part of the conversation, but
bade her a grave and respectful good-night.</p>

<p>Left alone, poor Claire could only sigh in
a disappointed way; as usual, she had not
said the words she meant to say, and she
could but feel that she had accomplished
nothing. It had been her father's motto to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
spend no time alone with a human being
without learning whether he belonged to the
army; and if not, making an effort to secure
his enlistment. Claire, looking on, had
known more than one young man, and middle-aged
man, and not a few children, who
had reported in after days that a word from
her father had been their starting-point.
Sadly, she mourned, oftentimes, because she
had not her father's tact and judgment. It
had seemed to her that this young man,
with his handsome face and his handsome
fortune, ought to be won for Christ. Why
did not his mother win him, or his sister?
Why did not she? She could but try; so
she tried, and apparently had failed; and
she was still so young a worker that she
sighed, and felt discouraged, instead of being
willing to drop the seed, and leave the results
with God. She belonged to that great
company of seed-sowers who are very anxious
to see the mysterious processes that go on
underground, with which they have nothing
whatever to do.</p>

<p>The next day Claire went back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Academy. Her twisted ankle was still to
be petted and nursed, and the piano had to
move from the music-room to a vacant one
next to Claire's own, and the chapel and
dining-room did without her for a while,
but the work of the day was resumed, and
went steadily forward.</p>

<p>It was not without earnest protest that
she left the home which had opened so
royally to receive her; and it is safe to say
that every member of the family missed
her, none more than Alice, who had found
a relief in her conversations from the <i>ennui</i>
and unrest which possessed her. Louis, too,
had added his entreaties that the burdens of
life at the Academy should not be assumed
so soon, and evidently missed something
from the home after her departure. It was
when he was helping her to the sleigh that
he said:</p>

<p>"You did not answer my question about
the old church and your interest in it; may
I call some evening, and get my answer?"</p>

<p>"We shall be glad to see you at the
Academy," she had replied, cordially, "but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
can answer your question now. It is because
it is the church of Christ, and it is my
duty to do for it in every way all that I
can."</p>

<p>"But," he said, puzzled, "how is it that
the church fathers, and, for that matter, the
church mothers, have let it get into such a
wretched state of repair? Why haven't they
a duty concerning it, rather than a stranger
in their midst?"</p>

<p>"I did not say that they had not; but
they don't have to report to me; the Head
of the Church will see to that."</p>

<p>Then Dennis, the Academy man-of-all-work,
had taken the reins, while Louis was in the
act of tucking the robes more carefully about
her, and driven rapidly away.</p>

<p>"It is queer how things work," Ruth Jennings
said, as a party of the girls gathered
around their teacher to report progress.
"There are a dozen things that have had to
lie idle, waiting for you. Why do you suppose
we had to be interrupted in our plans,
and almost stand still and do nothing, while
you lay on a couch with a sprained ankle?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
I'm sure we were doing nice things and
right things, and we needed you, and it
could do no possible good to anybody for
you to lie and suffer up there for a week.
I do say it looks sometimes as if things just
<i>happened</i> in this world, or else were managed
by somebody who hated the world and every
good plan that was made for it. Don't you
really think that Satan has a good deal of
control, Miss Benedict?"</p>

<p>But there were reasons why Miss Benedict
thought it would be as well not to let
her pupil wander off just then on a misty
sea of questionings. As for herself, she had
no doubt that the interruption was for some
good end; it is true, she could not see the
end, but she trusted it.</p>

<p>You are to remember that she had had
her sharper lessons, beside which all this was
the merest child's play. Those girls could
not possibly know how that awful "why"
had tortured her through days and nights
until that memorable Sunday night when
God gave her victory. What interruptions
had come to her! Father and fortune, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
home, and life-work, cut off in a moment;
the whole current of her life changed;
changed in ways that would not do even to
hint to the girls; what was a sprained
ankle and a few days of inaction compared
with these! Yet their evident chafing over
the loss of time opened her eyes to a new
truth. It seemed such a trivial thing to
her, that she could scarce restrain her lips
from a smile over their folly in dwelling on
it, until suddenly there dashed over her the
thought:</p>

<p>"What if, in the light of Heaven, my interruptions
all seem as small as this?"</p>

<p>The interrupted work was now taken up
with renewed energy, and indeed blossomed
at once into new varieties.</p>

<p>"What we must do next is to give a
concert."</p>

<p>This was the spark that the music-teacher
threw into the midst of the group of girls
who occupied various attitudes about her
chair. It was evening, and they were gathered
in her room for a chat as to ways
and means. Several days had passed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the foot was so far recovered that its owner
promised it a walk down the church aisle
on the following Sabbath, provided Dennis
could arrange to have it taken to the door.
It still, however, occupied a place of honor
among the cushions, and Claire sat back in
the depths of a great comfortable rocker
that had been brought from the parlor for
her use.</p>

<p>"A concert!" repeated Ruth, great dismay
in her voice, "us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, us."</p>

<p>"Who would come?" This from Nettie.</p>

<p>"Everybody will come after we are ready,
if we have managed our part of the work
well, and put our tickets low enough, and
exerted ourselves to sell them. Oh, I don't
mean <i>play</i>! I mean work! We would make
ready for a first-class entertainment. Let me
see, are you not all my music pupils? Yes,
every one of you, either vocal or piano
pupils. What is more natural than to suppose
that 'Miss Claire Benedict, assisted by
her able and efficient class of pupils,' can
'give an entertainment in the audience-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of the church,' etc? Isn't that the way the
advertisements head?"</p>

<p>"For the benefit of the church?"</p>

<p>But to this suggestion Miss Benedict promptly
shook her head:</p>

<p>"No, for the benefit of ourselves."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>INNOVATIONS.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>I&nbsp;&nbsp;DISLIKE that way of doing things.
People are being educated to suppose
that they are engaged in a benevolent enterprise
when they attend a benefit concert
or entertainment. Those who can not afford
to go ease their consciences by saying, 'Oh,
well, it is for benevolence;' when it really
isn't, you know; it is for self-gratification
or self-improvement, and people who ought
to give twenty-five dollars for a thing learn
to tell themselves that they went to the
twenty-five cent supper, or concert, and that
is their share, they suppose. Let us invite
them to come to our concert because we
believe that we can entertain them, and
that it will pay them to be present.</div>

<p>"The fact is, girls, the church of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
doesn't <i>need</i> any benefit. We degrade it
by talking as though it did. No, we will
divide the proceeds of the concert in shares
among ourselves; that is we, the workers,
will for the time being go into business
and earn money that shall be ours. We
will not plead poverty, or ask people to listen
to us because of benevolence; we will
simply give them a chance to hear a good
thing if they want to, and the money shall
be ours to do exactly what we please with.
Of course, if we please to give every cent of
it to the church, that is our individual affair."</p>

<p>New ground this, for those girls; they
had never before heard the like; but there
was an instant outgrowth of self-respect because
of it.</p>

<p>"Then we can't <i>coax</i> people to buy tickets?"
said Nettie. "I'm so glad."</p>

<p>"Of course not. The very utmost that
propriety will allow us to do will be to exhibit
our goods for sale, so much for such
an equivalent, and allow people the privilege
of choosing what they will do, and
where they will go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls, each and all, agreed that from
that standpoint they would as soon offer
tickets for sale as not; and instantly they
stepped upon that new platform and argued
from it in the future, to the great amazement
and somewhat to the bewilderment of
some of their elders.</p>

<p>Thereafter, rehearsals for the concert became
the daily order of things; not much
time to spend each day, for nothing could
be done until lessons were over and all regular
duties honorably discharged. The more
need then for promptness and diligence on
the part of each helper, and the more glaringly
improper it became to delay matters
by having to stay behind for a half-prepared
lesson. Never had the Academy, or the
village, for that matter, been so full of
eager, throbbing, healthy life, as those girls
made it.</p>

<p>Their numbers grew, also. At first, the
music-class was disposed, like the others, to
be exclusive, and to shake its head with a
lofty negative when one and another of the
outsiders proposed this or that thing which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
they would do to help. But Miss Benedict
succeeded in tiding them over that shoal.</p>

<p>"It is their church, girls, as well as ours.
We must not hinder them from showing
their love."</p>

<p>"Great love they have had," sneered one;
"they never thought of doing a thing until
we commenced."</p>

<p>But they were all honest, these girls, and
this very one who had offered her sneer,
added in sober second thought:</p>

<p>"Though, to be sure, for the matter of
that, neither did we, until you begun it.
Well, let them come in; I don't care."</p>

<p>"And we want to do so much," said Miss
Benedict, with enthusiasm; "if I were you
I would take all the help I could get."</p>

<p>Meantime, the other schemes connected
with this gigantic enterprise flourished. There
seemed no end to the devices for money-making,
all of them in somewhat new channels,
too.</p>

<p>"Not a tidy in the enterprise," said Ruth
Jennings, gravely, as she tried to explain
some of the work to her mother. "Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
ever heard of a church getting itself repaired
without the aid of tidies and pin-cushions!
I wonder when they began with such things,
mother? Do you suppose St. Paul had to
patronize fairs, and buy slippers and things,
for the benefit of churches in Ephesus or
Corinth?"</p>

<p>The bewildered mother, with a vague idea
that Ruth was being almost irreverent, could
not, for all that, decide how to answer her.</p>

<p>"For there isn't any religion in those
things, of course," she said to the equally-puzzled
father, "and it did sound ridiculous
to hear St. Paul's name brought into it!
That Miss Benedict has all sorts of new
ideas."</p>

<p>In the course of time, the boys (who are
quite likely to become interested in anything
that has deeply interested the girls) were
drawn into service. Here, too, the ways of
working were unusual and suggestive. Miss
Benedict heard of one who had promised to
give all the cigars he would probably have
smoked in two months' time, whereupon she
made this eager comment:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, what a pity that it is not going to
take us fifty years to repair the church! then
we would get him to promise to give us the
savings of cigars until it was done!"</p>

<p>This was duly reported to him, and gave
him food for thought.</p>

<p>Another promised the savings from sleigh-rides
that he had intended to take, and another
gravely wrote down in Ruth Jennings'
note-book: "Harry Matthews, $1.10; the price
of two new neckties and a bottle of hair
oil!" There was more than fun to some of
these entries. Some of the boys could not
have kept their pledges if there had not
been these queer little sacrifices.</p>

<p>One evening there was a new development.
Ruth Jennings brought the news.
The much-abused, long-suffering, neglectful
sexton of the half-alive church notified the
startled trustees that he had received a
louder call to the church on the other corner,
and must leave them. It really was
startling news; for bad as he had been,
not one in the little village could be thought
of who would be likely to supply his place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth reported her father as filled with
consternation.</p>

<p>"I wish I were a man!" savagely announced
Anna Graves, "then I would offer
myself for the position at once. It is as
easy to make three dollars a month in that
way as it is in any other that I know of."</p>

<p>That was the first development of the
new idea. Miss Benedict bestowed a sudden
glance, half of amusement, half of
pleasure, on her aspiring pupil, and was
silent.</p>

<p>"If it were not for the fires," was Nettie
Burdick's slow-spoken sentence, rather as if
she were thinking aloud than talking. That
is the way the idea began to grow.</p>

<p>Then Ruth Jennings, with a sudden dash,
as she was very apt to enter into a subject:</p>

<p>"It is no harder to make fires in church
stoves than it is in sitting-room ones. I've
done that often. I say, girls, let's do it!"</p>

<p>Every one of them knew that she meant
the church stoves instead of the sitting-room
ones, and that was the way that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
idea took on flesh, and stood up before
them.</p>

<p>There followed much eager discussion and
of course some demurs. Nothing ever was
done yet, or ever will be, without somebody
objecting to it. At least, this was what
Ruth said; and she added that she could
not, to save her life, help being a little more
settled in a determination after she had heard
somebody oppose it a trifle.</p>

<p>However, the trustees opposed it more than
a trifle. They were amazed. Such an innovation
on the time-honored ways of South
Plains had never been heard of before. Argument
ran high. The half-doubtful girls came
squarely over to the aggressive side, and
waxed eloquent over the plan. It was carried
at last, as Miss Benedict, looking on
and laughing, told the girls she knew it
would be.</p>

<p>"When you get fairly roused, my girls, I
observe that you are quite apt to carry the
day." She did not tell them that they were
girls after her own heart, but I think perhaps
she looked it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>One request the trustees growled vigorously
over, which was that the new sextons
should be paid in advance for a half-year's
work. What if they failed?</p>

<p>"We won't fail," said Ruth indignantly,
"and if we do, can't you conceive of the
possibility of our being honest? We will not
keep a cent of the precious money that has
not been earned."</p>

<p>Whereupon, Mr. Jennings, in a private
conference with the trustees, went over to
the enemy's side, and promised to stand
security for them, remarking apologetically
that the girls had all gone crazy over something,
his Ruth among the number. Therefore
eighteen dollars were gleefully added
to the treasury. The sum was certainly
growing.</p>

<p>The Sabbath following the installation of
the new sextons marked a change in the
appearance of the old church. The floors
had been carefully swept and cleansed, the
young ladies drawing on their precious funds
for the purpose of paying a woman who had
scrubbed vigorously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would be more fascinating," Ruth Jennings
frankly admitted, "to let all the improvements
come in together in one grand
blaze of glory; but then it would be more
decent to have those floors scrubbed, and I
move that we go in for decency, to the sacrifice
of glory, if need be."</p>

<p>So they did. Not a particle of dust was
to be seen on that Sabbath morning anywhere
about the sanctuary. From force of habit,
the men carefully brushed their hats with
their coat-sleeves as they took possession of
them again, the service over; but the look
of surprise on the faces of some over the
discovery that there was nothing to brush
away, was a source of amusement to a few
of the watchful girls.</p>

<p>Also the few stragglers who returned for
the evening service were caught looking
about them in a dazed sort of way, as
though they deemed it just possible that
there might be an incipient fire in progress
that threatened the building. Not that a
new lamp had been added; the chimneys had
simply been washed in soapsuds, and polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
until they shone, and new wicks had been
furnished, the workers declaring that their
consciences really would not allow them to
do less. The effect of these very commonplace
efforts was somewhat astonishing, even
to them.</p>

<p>"It is well we did it," affirmed Anna
Graves with serious face. "I believe we
ought to get the people used to these things
by degrees or they will be frightened."</p>

<p>One question Claire puzzled over in silence:
Did the minister really preach a
better sermon that evening? Was it possible
that the cleanliness about him might
have put a little energy into his discouraged
heart, or had she been so tired with
her week of toil, that to see every one of
her dozen girls out to church, and sit back
and look at them through the brightness of
clean lamps, was restful and satisfying?
She found that she could not decide on the
minister as yet. Perhaps the carrying of
such a load as that church, for years, was
what had taken the spring out of his voice
and the life out of his words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>About these things nothing must be said,
yet could not something be done? How
could she and her girls help that pastor?</p>

<p>Meantime, some of the girls came to her
one evening, bursting with laughter:</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Benedict, we have a new recruit!
You couldn't guess who. We shall
certainly succeed now, with such a valuable
reinforcement. Oh, girls, we know now
why Miss Benedict sprained her ankle, and
kept us all waiting for a week! This is a
direct result from that week's work."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" said
Miss Benedict, with smiling eyes and sympathetic
voice. It was a great addition to
her power over those girls that she held
herself in readiness always to join their
fun at legitimate moments. Sad-hearted she
often was, but what good that those young
things should see it? "Who is your recruit?"</p>

<p>"Why, Bud!" they said, and then there
were shouts of laughter again, and Ruth
could hardly command her voice to explain:
"He came to me last night&mdash;tramped all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the way up to our house in the snow,
after meeting&mdash;because he said he wasn't so
''fraid' of me as he was of 'all them
others.' Was that a compliment, girls, or
an insult? Yes, Miss Benedict, he wants to
help; offers to 'tend the fires,' and I shouldn't
wonder if he could do it much better than
it has been done at least. It was real
funny, and real pitiful, too. He said it was
the only 'livin' thing he knew how to do,'
and <i>that</i> he was sure and certain he could
do, and if it would help any, he would be
awful glad to join."</p>

<p>"But doesn't he want to be paid?"
screamed one of the girls.</p>

<p>"Paid? not he! I tell you he wants to
join us. He said he wanted to do it to
please <i>her</i>. That means you, Miss Benedict.
You have won his heart in some way. Oh,
it is the fruit of the sprained ankle. You
know, girls, she said it was surely for some
good purpose." Then they all went off into
ecstatic laughter again. They were just at
the age when it takes so little to convulse
girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I am not yet enlightened," explained
Claire, as soon as there was hope of her
being heard. "Who is Bud?"</p>

<p>"Oh, is it possible you don't remember
him? That is too cruel, when he is just
devoted to you! Why, he is the furnace-boy
at the Ansteds. I don't know where
he saw you. He muttered something about
the furnace and the register that I did not
understand; but he plainly intimated that
he was ready to be your devoted servant,
and die for you, if need be, or at least,
make the church fires as many days and
nights as you should want them. Now the
question is, what shall we do to the poor
fellow?"</p>

<p>The furnace-boy at the Ansteds! Oh, yes,
Claire remembered him, a great, blundering,
apparently half-witted, friendless, hopeless boy.
Claire's heart had gone out in pity for him
the first time she ever saw him. He had
been sent to her room to make some adjustment
of the register-screw, and she had
asked him if he understood furnaces, and if
he liked to work, and if the snow was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
deep, and a few other aimless questions, just
for the sake of speaking to him with a
pleasant voice, and seeming to take an interest
in his existence. Her father's heart
had always overflowed with tenderness and
helpfulness for all such boys. Claire had
pleased herself&mdash;or perhaps I might say
saddened herself&mdash;with thinking what her
father, if he were alive, and should come in
contact with Bud, would probably try to do
for him. She could think of ways in which
her father would work to help him, but she
sadly told herself that all that was passed;
her father was gone where he could not
help Bud, and there were few men like
him; and the boy would probably have to
stumble along through a cold and lonely
world. She had not thought of one thing
that <i>she</i> could do for him; indeed, it had
not so much as occurred to her as possible
that there could be anything. After that
first day she had not seen him again, until
he came to the music-room with a message
for Ella, and she had turned her head and
smiled, and said "Good-morning!" and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
was really all that she knew about Bud.
She had forgotten his existence; and she
had been sorrowing because her week at
the Ansteds seemed to have accomplished
nothing at all.</p>

<p>Her face was averted for a moment from
the girls, and some of them, noticing, actually
thought that their gay banter was offensive,
and was what caused the heightened
color on her cheeks as she turned back to
them.</p>

<p>They could not have understood, even had
she tried to explain, that it was a blush of
shame over the thought that the one whom
possibly she might have won from that home
for the Master's service she had forgotten,
and reached out after those whom, possibly,
she was not sent to reach. Her eyes were
open now; she would do what she could to
repair blunders.</p>

<p>"Do with him?" she said, going back to
Ruth's last question. "We'll accept him, of
course, and set him to work; I should not
be greatly surprised if he should prove one
of the most useful helpers on our list before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the winter is over. Look at the snow coming
down, and we have a rehearsal to-night;
don't you believe he can shovel paths, as
well as make fires?"</p>

<p>"Sure enough!" said those girls, and they
went away pleased with the addition to the
circle of workers, and prepared every one to
greet him as a helper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>BLIND.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>I&nbsp;&nbsp;SUPPOSE there was never a project
that went forward on swifter wings than
did this one, born of the stranger's sermon
preached that night in the little neglected
church at South Plains. Sometimes I am
sad over the thought that he knew nothing
about it. Nobody, so far as I am aware,
ever took time to tell him that he was the
prime mover in the entire scheme.</div>

<p>The numerous plans for making money
made progress with the rest. Prospered, indeed,
to a degree that filled the young
workers with amazement&mdash;I might almost
say, with awe. They grew into the feeling
that Miss Benedict was right, and that God
himself smiled on their scheme, and gave it
the power of his approval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>As the days went by, the reading spirit
in the enterprise grew almost too busy to
write her daily hurried postals to her mother.
These same postals were gradually filled with
items that astonished and somewhat bewildered
the mother and daughter who watched
so eagerly for them.</p>

<p>"Would mamma be so kind as to call on
Mr. Parkhurst, the one who was chief man
at the carpet factory up there by papa's old
mill, you know? Would she, on the next
bright day, take the blue car line and ride
up there and talk with him? The ride
would do her good, and it would be such a
help to the girls. They would need only
a little carpeting, it was true; but if Mr.
Parkhurst would be so kind as to sell to
them at wholesale, factory prices, it would
make a great difference with their purses,
and she was sure he would be pleased to
do it if mamma would ask him, because you
know, mamma, he felt very grateful to papa
for help years ago."</p>

<p>This was the substance of one postal.</p>

<p>"One would think that Claire had bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the little old church, and was fitting it up
for her future home," commented Dora, a
trifle annoyed. The truth was, her sister
seemed almost unpardonably satisfied and
happy away from them.</p>

<p>Another day would bring further petitions:
"Would it be too much for mamma to look
at wall-papers, something very neat and plain,
not at all expensive, but suited to a small
church; and make an estimate of the expense
in round numbers?" Then would follow a
line of figures, indicating length and breadth
and height.</p>

<p>"What a child she is!" would the mother
say, sighing and then smiling&mdash;the smiles
came last and oftenest in speaking of Claire.
"She was always very much like your father,
and it grows on her. Well, we must see
about the wall-paper; perhaps this afternoon
will be a good time to give to it." And
the commissions were executed promptly
and with painstaking care; and Claire could
see that both mother and Dora were becoming
interested in the old church at South
Plains, and were absorbing a good many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
their otherwise leisure and sad hours in
travelling hither and thither in search of
shades and grades that would be likely to
give her satisfaction. Samples were sent to
her, and astonishingly low figures accompanied
some of them; figures which were communicated
with shining eyes to the deeply-interested
girls, and they sent messages of thanks
to the mother and daughter far away.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Ansteds were not forgotten.
There was a special committee meeting one
evening in Miss Benedict's room. A letter
had come "from the foreign member of our
firm," Miss Benedict had explained, laughing,
meaning her mother, and its contents
were to be discussed and voted upon. In
the midst of the interest came a message
from Mrs. Foster: "Would Miss Benedict be
kind enough to come to the parlor for a
few minutes, to see Mr. and Miss Ansted?"</p>

<p>"I must go, girls," Claire said, rising
quickly. "This is the third attempt Miss
Ansted has made to call on me since their
kindness to me, and I have either been out
or engaged in giving lessons. You will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to excuse me for a little while. I will return
as soon as I can. Meantime, I am
going to see if I can't secure help in that
direction for our enterprise."</p>

<p>"You won't," said Mary Burton, emphatically.
"They say Alice Ansted is a good
singer, but she has been heard to say that
she would as soon think of singing in a barn
as in our church; and that the one time
she heard our organ, she thought it was some
mice squealing in the ceiling."</p>

<p>"Wait until we get it tuned, and the
pedals oiled," said Ruth Jennings; "I don't
believe it will be such a bad-sounding instrument.
At least, it is my opinion that Alice
Ansted will find herself able to endure in
that line what Miss Benedict is. Girls, I
heard last night that she is a beautiful
singer. Isn't it queer that she has never
sung for us?"</p>

<p>This last was after Claire had left them,
but as she was about to close the door, Ruth
Jennings had made a remark which had
drawn her back:</p>

<p>"Get Louis Ansted to pledge us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
money which he spends in wines each year,
and that will do us good and him too."</p>

<p>"Does he use wines freely?" Claire said,
turning back.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed he does; altogether too freely
for his good, if the village boys can be believed.
I heard that he came home intoxicated
only night before last."</p>

<p>"Why, that is nothing new!" added Nettie
Burdick; "he often comes home in that
condition. Dick Fuller says it is a common
experience; and he would know what he is
talking about, for he has to be at the depot
when the last train comes in. Besides, he
makes his money in that way; why shouldn't
he patronize himself?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Claire asked, her
face troubled.</p>

<p>"Why, his money is all invested in one
of the distilleries. He has a fortune in his
own right, Miss Benedict, left him by his
grandmother, and he invested it in Westlake's
distillery. He is one of the owners,
though his name does not appear in the
firm; the Ansted pride would not like that;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
but I know this is true, for my uncle transacted
the business for him."</p>

<p>Claire started again, making no comment,
but this time she moved more slowly. There
were reasons why the news gave her a
special thrust.</p>

<p>The callers greeted her with evident pleasure,
and expressed their disappointment at
having failed to see her in their other attempts,
and gave her messages from their
mother to the effect that she was to consider
their house one of her homes. Fanatic
though she was, it was plainly to be seen
that they had resolved to tolerate the fanaticism
for the sake of the pleasure of her
society.</p>

<p>There were other callers, and in a few
minutes the conversation, which had been general,
dropped into little side channels. Alice
Ansted, occupying a seat near Miss Benedict,
turned to her and spoke low:</p>

<p>"I have wanted to see you. What you
said to me that day has made me more dissatisfied
than ever, and that was unnecessary;
I was uncomfortable enough before. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
did not understand you. What is there that
you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"How do you know I want you to do
anything?" Claire could not resist the
temptation to ask the question, and to laugh
a little; her questioner's tone was so nervous,
so almost rebellious, and at the same
time so pettish.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know well enough. You expressed
surprise, and well&mdash;almost bewilderment&mdash;that
I did not find absorbing work in a
channel about which I know nothing. Suppose
I am a Christian, what then? What
do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Miss Ansted, I am not the
one of whom that inquiry should be made.
If you belong to the Lord Jesus, surely he
has work for you, and is able to point it
out, and to fill your heart with satisfaction
while you do his bidding."</p>

<p>There was a gesture almost of impatience.</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't understand such talk.
It sounds like 'cant' to me, and nothing
else; that is, it does when other people say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
it, but you seem different; you live differently,
some way, and interest yourself about
different matters from those which absorb
the people whom I have heard talk that
way. Now I ask you a straightforward
question: What do you want me to do?
What do you see that I could do, if I were
what you mean by being a Christian?"</p>

<p>Claire's face brightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is such a different question!"
she said. "I am really very glad of an opportunity
to answer it. I know a dozen
things that you could do. For instance, you
could throw yourself into the life of this
neglected, almost deserted church, and help
to make it what it should be; you could
give your time, and your money, and your
voice, to making it arise and shine."</p>

<p>"How? What on earth is there that I
could do, even if I wanted to do anything
in that direction, which I don't?"</p>

<p>"I know it, but that doesn't hinder me
from seeing what you <i>could</i> do. Why, if
you want me to be very specific, if you
have no better plan than we are working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
on to propose, you could join us with all
your heart, and work with us, and worship
with us on Sabbaths, and help us in our
preparations for a concert."</p>

<p>"And sing in that stuffy room, to the accompaniment
of that horrid little organ, and
for the benefit of such an audience as
South Plains would furnish! Thank you,
I don't mean to do it! What else?"</p>

<p>"Of what special use is it for me to suggest
ways, since you receive them with such
determined refusals?"</p>

<p>"That I may have the pleasure of seeing
how far your enthusiasm reaches. I would
call it fanaticism if I dared, Miss Benedict,
but that would be rude. Tell me what
next?"</p>

<p>Claire considered, Miss Ansted meantime
watching her closely. When at last she
spoke, her tone dropped lower, and was
graver:</p>

<p>"I wish with all my soul that you would
interest yourself in Bud."</p>

<p>"In Bud!" It was impossible not to give
a start of surprise, not to say dismay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
"Now, Miss Benedict, that passes comprehension!
What on earth is there that I
could do for a great, ignorant, blundering
clod like Bud? He has plenty to eat, and
is decently clothed without any assistance
from me. What more can you imagine he
wants?"</p>

<p>"He wants God," said Claire, solemnly,
"and the knowledge of him in the face of
Jesus Christ. He is to live forever, Miss
Ansted, as certainly as you are; and the
time hastens when food and clothing for
the soul will be a necessity for him as well
as to you, or he will appear before God
naked and starved, and you will have to
meet him there, and bear some of the
blame."</p>

<p>"I never heard a person talk so in my
life. Bud is not more than half-witted. I
doubt whether he knows that there is such
a being as God. What can you fancy it
possible for me to do for him?"</p>

<p>"Do you think, then, that he has no
soul?"</p>

<p>"Why, I did not say that! I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
he has, of course. He is not an animal,
though I must say he approaches very nearly
to the level of one."</p>

<p>"And don't you think that he will have
to die, and go to the judgment, and meet
God?"</p>

<p>"How dreadful all these things are! Of
course he will! but how can I help it?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he is ready?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he ever thought of such
a thing in his life. He hasn't mind enough,
probably, to comprehend."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so? Don't you believe
the boy to whom you can say, 'Close
the blinds on the north side, to shut out
the wind,' could understand if you said:
'Bud, God is as surely in the world as the
wind is, though you can not see either.
He has said that when you die you shall
see him, and that you shall live with him
in a beautiful home, if you will love him
here, and obey his orders; and what he
wants you to do is all printed in a book
that you can learn to read?' Do you think
Bud could not comprehend as much as that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never heard of such an idea in my
life!" said Miss Ansted. "I don't know
how to teach such things." And she turned
away and talked with a caller about the
travelling opera company who were to sing
in the city on the following evening.</p>

<p>Mr. Ansted had changed his seat, meantime,
and was waiting for his opportunity.
He turned to Claire the moment his sister
withdrew.</p>

<p>"I came to ask a favor of you this evening;
two of them, in fact; but the first is
on such strange ground for me, that I have
been studying all day how to put it."</p>

<p>"And have you decided?"</p>

<p>"No, left it in despair; only praying
that the Fates would be favorable to me,
and grant me opportunity and words. Here
is the opportunity, but where are the words?"</p>

<p>"I have always found it comfortable to
be as simple and direct as possible with all
communications. Suppose you see how fully
you can put the thought before me in a
single sentence."</p>

<p>The gentleman laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"That would be one way to make an interview
brief, if such were my desire. I can
not say, however, that that phase of the
subject troubles me any. Well, I will take
your advice, and put a large portion of my
thought into a short sentence: I wish you
could and would do something for Harry
Matthews."</p>

<p>It was not in the least what she had expected.
She supposed his words were to
preface a flattering invitation, or something
of that character. An apparently earnest
sentence, concerning a merry young fellow
in whom she was already somewhat interested,
filled her with surprise, and kept her
silent.</p>

<p>"Is that brief and abrupt enough?" he
asked, and then, without waiting for answer,
continued: "I mean it, strange as it may
seem; and I so rarely do unselfish things
that I can imagine it seems strange enough.
I haven't a personal thought in the matter.
Harry is a good fellow; a little fast, the
old ladies say, and shake their heads, but
they don't know what they mean by that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
The boy is a favorite of mine; and he is
one who has a good deal of force of character
without any will-power, if that is not
a contradiction. I fancy you know what I
mean. I am going to speak more plainly
now. Away back in some former generation&mdash;no,
I am going to tell the naked truth.
Do you know anything of his family, Miss
Benedict?"</p>

<p>"Not anything."</p>

<p>"Well, his father was a good man and a
drunkard. You think that is another contradiction
of terms. Perhaps it is, as you
would mean it, but not as I do. He was a
good, warm-hearted, whole-souled man, and he
drank himself into his grave; shipwrecked
his property, and left his widow and this
boy dependant on wealthy relatives, or on
themselves. Harry is trying to be a man,
and works hard, and is specially tempted in
the line at which I have hinted. I feel
afraid for him, and the only person in this
little wretch of a village whom I think
might help him is yourself. Will you try?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ansted, why don't you help him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>It was his turn to be taken aback. He
had not expected this answer. He had looked
for an instant and interested affirmative, and
he had expected to tell her more of Harry
Matthews, and of his peculiar associations
and temptations.</p>

<p>"I!" he said, and then he laughed. "Miss
Benedict, you are most remarkable as regards
your talent for asking strange questions.
It is evident that you are a stranger in
South Plains; and I don't know what the
gossips have been about, that they have not
posted you better. You should know that I
am really the last person in the neighborhood
who is expected to help anybody;
least of all, can I help Harry Matthews.
The most helpful thing that I can think of
for the boy is to keep away from me. My
influence over him is altogether bad, and
growing worse. What he needs is to be
drawn away from present associations entirely,
and, indeed, from his present associates,
of which I am often one. I fancy that
this organization of yours, in which he is
already interested, might be managed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
way to help him, and it occurred to me to
enlighten you in regard to him, and ask for
your helping hand."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ansted, I hope you will pardon the
rudeness, but your words sound to me almost
like those of an insane person. You
recognize your influence over a young man
to be evil, realize it to the extent that you
make an effort to have him withdrawn
from it, and yet if I understand you, make
no attempt to change the character of the
influence which you have over him. That
can not possibly be your meaning!"</p>

<p>"I think it is, about that. Don't you
understand? What is a mere entertainment
to me&mdash;a passing luxury, which I can afford,
and which does me no harm&mdash;is the very
brink of a precipice to poor Harry, owing
to his unfortunate inherited tendencies. I
would like to see him saved, but there is
nothing in particular that I can do."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said in genuine distress, "I
wonder if it is possible for a soul to be so
blind! You can do <i>everything</i>, Mr. Ansted;
and, moreover, how can you think you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a right to say that you are not personally
in danger from the same source? Men as
assured in position and as strong in mental
power as you have fallen by the hundreds.
Surely you know that there is no safety
from such a foe save in having none of
him."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? In that we would
differ. I am not fanatical in this matter.
I recognize Harry's danger, but I recognize
equally that I am built in a different mold,
and have different antecedents."</p>

<p>"And have no responsibilities connected
with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have," he said in utmost
good humor; "I assumed responsibility when
I came here to ask you to help him. It
was the best thing I could think of to do
for the boy. You think I am playing a
part, but upon honor, I am not. I know
his mother is anxious."</p>

<p>She wondered afterward whether it were
not an unwise question to ask, but said:</p>

<p>"Is not your mother anxious, Mr. Ansted?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least!" he answered smilingly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>STARTING FOR HOME.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT had been a stormy evening, and the
little company of busy people who had
gathered in the church for a rehearsal, were
obliged to plod home through an incipient
snow-storm; but they were in happy mood,
for the most successful rehearsal of the enterprise
had been held, and certain developments
had delighted their hearts.</div>

<p>To begin with: just as they had completed
a difficult chorus, the door leading
into the outside world had opened with a
decisive bang, and there had been an energetic
stamping of feet in the little entry,
and there appeared Alice and Louis Ansted.</p>

<p>There was still on Alice's face that curious
mixture of superiority and discontent
which Claire had always seen in her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here we are!" she said, in a tone that
expressed a sort of surprise with herself at
the idea. "It would be difficult to tell
why. Now, what do you want of me?"</p>

<p>Claire went forward to meet them, her
face bright with welcome.</p>

<p>"Have you really come to help us?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. I don't know why else
we should have appeared here in the storm.
It is snowing. I don't mind the storm,
though; only, why did I come? I don't
know; if you do, I wish you would tell
me."</p>

<p>"Well, I do. I know exactly. You came
to take the alto in this quartette we are arranging.
My girls were just assuring me
that there was not an alto voice in our
midst that could sustain the other parts.
What do you say now, girls?"</p>

<p>There was a good deal of satisfaction in
her tones. It amused her to think of Ruth's
discontented grumble but a moment before:</p>

<p>"If Alice Ansted did not feel so much
above us, she would be a glorious addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to this piece. Miss Benedict, her voice is
splendid. I don't like her, but I would
tolerate her presence if we could get her to
take the alto in this."</p>

<p>Then Mary Burton:</p>

<p>"Well, she won't; and you needn't think
of such a thing." It was at that moment
that the door had opened, and she came.</p>

<p>Claire went at once to the organ, and the
rehearsal of the quartette began.</p>

<p>I do not know but the girls themselves
would have been almost frightened had they
been sufficiently skilled in music to know
what a rare teacher they had. Claire Benedict's
voice was a special talent, God-given
as surely as her soul. Time was when it
had been one of her temptations, hard to
resist. Such brilliant and flattering futures
had opened before her, if she would but
consent to give "private rehearsals." There
is an intoxication about extravagant praise,
and Claire had for weeks been intoxicated
to the degree that she could not tell where
the line was drawn, and when the world
stepped in and claimed her as its special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
prize. It was then that the keen, clear-seeing
wise and tender father had used his
fatherly influence, and showed her the net
which Satan had warily spread. She had
supposed herself secure, after that. But
when the great financial crash came upon
them, and when the father was gone where
he could advise and shield no more, there
had come to her the temptation of her life.
It would have been so easy to have supported
her mother and sister in a style
somewhat like that to which they had been
accustomed; and to do this, she need not
descend in any sense to that which was in
itself wrong or unladylike. Those who would
have bought her voice were willing that
she should be as exclusive as she pleased.
But for the clear-sightedness of the father,
in those days when the other temptations
had been met, she would surely have yielded
to the pressure.</p>

<p>She came off victorious, but wounded.
When she had with determined face turned
from all these flattering offers, and entered
the only door which opened to her conscience&mdash;this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
one at South Plains&mdash;she had
told herself that three hundred dollars a
year did not hire her voice. So much of
herself she would keep to <i>herself</i>. She would
do no singing, either in public or private;
not a note. In order to teach even vocal
music, it was not necessary to exhibit her
powers of song. That sermon, however, had
swept this theory away, along with many
others. It is true, it had been almost exclusively
about the church; but you will
remember that it had dealt with the conscience;
and the conscience awakened on
one point, is far more likely to see plainly
in other directions. When next the subject
of song presented itself to her mind, Claire
Benedict was somewhat astonished to discover
that she had not given her <i>voice</i> when she
gave herself. She had not known it at the
time, but there had evidently been a mental
reservation, else she would not shrink so
from using her powers in this direction, in
this her new sphere of life. Some earnest
heart-searching had to be done. Was she
vain of her voice? she wondered, that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
was so unwilling to use it in the desolate
little sanctuary at South Plains; that she
could not even bring herself to do other
than <i>peep</i> the praises of God in the school
chapel. It was a revelation of self that
brought much humiliation with it. It was
even humiliating to discover that it took a
long and almost fierce struggle to overcome
the shrinking which possessed her. It was
not all pride; there was a relief in remembering
that. There was a sense in which her
voice seemed to belong to her happy and
buried past; something which her father
had loved, even exulted in, and which had
been largely kept for him. But this thought
of her father helped her. There was never
a thought connected with him that did not
help and strengthen. He would not have
approved&mdash;no, she did not put it that way,
she hated those past tenses as connected
with him&mdash;he <i>did not</i> approve of her hiding
her talent in a napkin; her happiness
should not be labeled "past;" was she not
in God's world? was she not the child of a
King? was not heaven before her, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
eternity there, with her father who had just
preceded the family by a few days? Did
she grudge him that? Was it well for her
to sit down weeping, and dumb, because he
had entered the palace a little in advance?</p>

<p>From this heart-searching, there had come
another victory; and if Claire Benedict did
not say in so many solemn words,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Take my voice, and let me sing<br />
Always, only, for my King,<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>she nevertheless consecrated it to His service,
and grew joyful over the thought that she
had this talent to give.</div>

<p>In making her selections for the coming
concert, she had with rare good taste kept
in mind the character of the audience which
would probably gather to listen, and the
capacities of her helpers. She chose simple,
tender melodies, narrative poems, such as
appeal to the heart, with one or two wonderful
solos, and this quartette, which was
new and difficult, but full of power.</p>

<p>They sang it presently, for the first time;
Claire and Alice Ansted, Harry Matthews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and a friend of his who had been drawn in
for the occasion. It was the first time that
even her girls had heard Claire's voice in
its power.</p>

<p>They said not a word when it was ended,
but they looked at one another in a
startled way, and presently Ruth Jennings
apologized in under tone for its power over
her:</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know what was the
matter with me. I never cried before at
the sound of music. I have read of people
doing it, and I thought it rather absurd, but
I could not help it. Girls, I wonder what
the Ansteds think?"</p>

<p>What Alice Ansted thought might have
been expressed, in part, in her first astonished
comment:</p>

<p>"The idea of your singing in South
Plains!"</p>

<p>However, she said more than that in the
course of the evening; said things which
gave Claire much more pleasure. For instance:</p>

<p>"How horridly out of order that little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
wretch is! Why don't you have it tuned?
It would be a little more endurable then;
or, at least, a little less intolerable. Our
piano-tuner is coming out to-morrow, and I
mean to send him down here. The idea of
having nothing but a rickety chair for a
music-stool! Louis, what has become of that
piano-stool we used to have in our library
in town? Did you store it with the other
things? Well, just bring it out to-morrow.
Miss Benedict will get another fall if she
depends on this old chair any longer. What
is that you are sitting on? A pile of old
music-books, I declare! The whole thing is
disgraceful. Miss Benedict, do you sing
'Easter Bells?' I should think it would
just fit your voice. It runs so high that I
can do nothing with it; but I wouldn't
mind taking the alto with you. Louis, suppose
you bring out the music to-morrow,
and let her look at it."</p>

<p>And before the evening was over, it became
evident to those girls that Miss Ansted
was committed to the concert, at least.
They were half-jealous, it is true. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
enjoyed having their prize all to themselves.
Still, she had bloomed before them that
evening into such an unexpected prize, that
they were almost awed, and a little glad
that her glorious voice should have such an
appropriate setting as was found in Alice
Ansted; and besides, it was a sort of a
triumph to say: "Why, the Ansteds are
going to help us at our concert! They have
never sung in South Plains before!"</p>

<p>Louis, too, contributed something besides
his fine tenor voice:</p>

<p>"What makes your stove smoke so, Bud?"
he questioned.</p>

<p>And Bud explained, with some stammering,
that there was something wrong about
the pipe; one joint did not fit right into
another joint&mdash;or, as he expressively stated
it, "One j'int was too small, and t'other
was too large, and so they didn't work
well."</p>

<p>"I should say not," said Louis, amused.
"The wonder is that they work at all, with
such a double difficulty as that to contend
with. Well, Bud, you tell Hawkins to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in to-morrow, and see what is the matter
with the joints, and make the large one
small and the small one large, or fix it in
any other way that suits his genius, so that
the thing won't smoke, and send his bill to
me. We will have our throats all raw here,
before the important day arrives."</p>

<p>"A music-stool, and an organ-tuner, and a
new elbow for the stove-pipe," commented
Ruth Jennings, in a complacent tone, as
they walked home in the snow. "The Ansteds
are good for something in the world,
after all."</p>

<p>About the home-going there was some talk.
Claire, down by the stove adjusting her rubbers,
caught the watchful, wistful gaze of
Bud, and remembered what Ruth had said
about her influence over him. How could
she exert it so that it would tell on Bud
forever? What was there that she could say
to him? When was her opportunity? Right
at hand, perhaps; she would try.</p>

<p>"Bud," she said, "are you going to see
me home through this snow-storm? or must
you make haste up the hill?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>It gave her a feeling of pain to see the
sudden blaze of light on his dark, swarthy
face. What a neglected, friendless life he
must have led, that a kind word or two
could have such power over him!</p>

<p>"Me!" he said. "Do you mean it? I'd
like to carry your books and things, and I
could take the broom and sweep along before
you. Might I go? Oh, I haven't got
to hurry. My work is all done."</p>

<p>She laughed lightly. What a picture it
would be for Dora, could she see her plunging
through the freshly-fallen snow, Bud at
her side, or a step ahead, with a broom!</p>

<p>"I don't need the broom," she said; "it
has not snowed enough for that; and I am
prepared, if it has; see my boots. I like
the snow. You may carry my books, please,
and we will have a nice walk and talk.
The girls are all ready now, I think. You
put out the lamps, and I will wait for you
at the door."</p>

<p>Out in the beautiful, snowy world, just
as Bud's key clicked in the look, Louis Ansted
came up to Claire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Benedict, let me take you home in
the sleigh. I am sorry to have kept you
waiting a moment; but my blundering driver
had something wrong about the harness, and
the horses were fractious. They are composed
enough now, and Alice is in the
sleigh. Let me assist you out to it, please."</p>

<p>If it had been moonlight, he might have
seen the mischievous sparkle in Claire's eyes.
It was so amusing to be engaged to Bud,
while his master held out his hands for
her books, as a matter of course, and poor
Bud stood aside, desolate and miserable.
Evidently he expected nothing else but to
be left.</p>

<p>Claire's voice rang out clear, purposely to
reach Bud's ear:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, thank you, Mr. Ansted! I am
fond of walking; I don't mind the snow in
the least, and I have promised myself the
pleasure of a walk through it with Bud.
Thank you!" as he still urged, "my ankle
is quite well again, and I have had no exercise
to-day; I really want the walk. We
thank you very much for your help this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
evening, Mr. Ansted. Good-night! Are you
ready, Bud?"</p>

<p>And they trudged away, leaving the discomfited
gentleman standing beside his pawing
horses.</p>

<p>"It is some absurd idea of benefiting Bud
that has taken possession of her," explained
Alice, as the sleigh flew by the two. "She
spoke to me about trying to help him. She
is just as full of queer notions as she can
be. The idea of helping Bud!"</p>

<p>But the master of the horses said nothing.
He was prepared to think, but not to
confess, that such as she might help even
Bud.</p>

<p>That young man, though his tread was
certainly heavy enough, seemed to himself
to be walking on air, such a wonderful
thing had come to him! Years and years
had passed since anybody had spoken to
him, save in short, sharp words, to give an
order of some sort. Now this one, who
said "Good-morning!" and "Good-evening!"
when she met him, as pleasantly as she
spoke to any, who had asked him kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
questions about himself, who had told him
that the stoves were very clean, and that
it seemed pleasant to have the church warm,
was actually letting him walk home with
her and carry her books! Poor Bud wished
there were more of them, and that they
were as heavy as lead, that he might show
how gladly he carried them for her sake.
She, meantime, was wondering how she
could best speak, to help him in any way.</p>

<p>"Don't you sing at all?" she asked, her
eyes falling on the pile of music-books, and
seizing upon the question as a way of opening
conversation.</p>

<p>"Me!" said Bud, with an embarrassed
laugh. "Oh, no, I can't sing, any more than
a calf can."</p>

<p>"But you like music, don't you?" She
was still making talk, to try to put him at
his ease.</p>

<p>Bud found voice then for some of the
feeling which possessed him.</p>

<p>"I don't like most folks' music a bit;
but I like the kind you make, I do so."</p>

<p>He spoke with tremendous energy; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
was no mistaking the intensity of his conclusions.
Claire laughed a little. They were
not getting on very well.</p>

<p>Bud's musical tastes had probably not
been cultivated. He liked the music that
she made, because the same voice had spoken
kind words to him. Well, in that case,
what would he think of the music of the
angels? she wondered.</p>

<p>Some of the thought she put into words:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you where you will like the
music, Bud&mdash;when you get to heaven. Did
you ever try to think what that singing
would sound like?"</p>

<p>"Me!" said Bud again, and this time
there was unutterable amazement in his
voice. It was clear that the idea of hearing
the music of heaven had never dawned on
his mind.</p>

<p>Claire replied hesitatingly, in almost a
plaintive tone. The desolation of a soul
that had no heaven to look to, touched her
strangely just then:</p>

<p>"Bud, you are going there to hear the
music, are you not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon not." He spoke the words
gravely, with a singularly mournful intonation.
"Heaven ain't for such as me. You
see, ma'am, I'm nothing but an ignorant,
blundering fellow, that hadn't never ought
to have been born."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bud! I am so sorry to hear you
speak such dreadful words! I didn't expect
it of you. Why, don't you know you are
the same as saying that the Lord Jesus
Christ has not told the truth? He said he
came to earth in order that you might live
forever with him in heaven, and he loves
you, Bud, and is watching for you to give
yourself to him. And now, you even say
you ought not to have been made!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean no harm! I was only a-sayin'
what I've heard folks say time and
time again about me; they didn't see what
I was made for, and I didn't either."</p>

<p>"You were made to love God, and to do
work for him, and to live with him forever
in his beautiful heaven. If you don't go
there, it will make his heart sad. Oh, Bud,
if I were you, I wouldn't treat him so!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>LOST FRIENDS.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"I &nbsp;&nbsp;NEVER knew nothing about it," Bud
said, earnestly. "I never heard as anybody
cared in particular what became of me,
only so that I got out of folks' way and
didn't bother."</div>

<p>"Why, Bud! have you never heard the
minister urge you to give yourself to
Jesus?"</p>

<p>But Bud shook his head energetically.</p>

<p>"No minister never spoke to me," he said.
"I goes to church every once in a while,
because I gets my work all done, and don't
know what else to do. When the horses
are gone, and the dog is gone, I'm awful
lonesome up there," inclining his head toward
the hill up which the Ansted horses
were now speeding, "and the dog always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
goes to town to church, along with the
horses, and so I went down here for company
kind of; but the minister never said
nothing to me. I've listened a good bit, off
and on, because I felt lonesome, and did not
know what else to do; but he never said
nothing about me, nor told me a body cared.
It was all for them other folks, that has
homes and good clothes."</p>

<p>What a pitiful story was this, coming up
from the depths of the great, lonesome heart,
surrounded on every hand by nominal Christians!
Claire could not keep the tears from
her eyes, and dared not speak for a moment,
her voice was so full of them.</p>

<p>"Did you never read any verses in the
Bible?" she asked at last. "You can read,
can't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes'm, I can read. I learned how
when I lived with Mr. Stokes, back there
in the country. Little Jack, he showed me
my letters, and my easy readings, and all,
and I could read to him quite a bit. Jack
wasn't but eight years old; but he was
smart, and he was good, and he died." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
lonely story ended with a sigh. There was
evidently a memory of better times enjoyed
in the dim past.</p>

<p>Claire questioned to get at the utmost of
his knowledge:</p>

<p>"And didn't Jack tell you anything about
Jesus and Heaven?"</p>

<p>"He did that, ma'am. He talked a good
deal about being sent for to go there; and
he was, too; I make sure of that, for he
went away sudden in the night, the <i>life</i>
did, you know, and he had a smile on his
face in the morning, just as he looked when
he was very glad about anything, and I am
about sure that it was just as he said it
would be about the angels coming, and all;
and he used to think they would come for
me, too. 'Your turn will come, Bud,' he
used to say to me. He was a little fellow,
you see"&mdash;this last was in an apologetic
tone&mdash;"he thought the world of Bud, and
he thought everybody else was like him,
and that what was fixed for him would be
fixed for Bud. I used to like to hear him
say it, because he was a little fellow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
he liked me; but I knew that what was for
him wasn't for me."</p>

<p>"Bud, you are mistaken. Little Jack was
right about it all. There was no doubt but
that the angels came for him, and they will
come for you, if you want to go where
Jack is. Jesus Christ, Jack's Saviour, was
the one who told him to tell you about it."</p>

<p>"Eh!" said Bud, in a sort of stupid
amaze. "Did you know Jack, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't know him, but I know his
Saviour, the one who sent for him to go
home to heaven; and I know that what he
told you is true; for the same one has
told me the same thing: told me to coax
you, Bud, to be ready to go where little
Jack is. Will you?"</p>

<p>"I'd go on my hands and knees all night
through the woods to see little Jack again,
but I don't know the way."</p>

<p>"Bud, did you know that the Bible was
God's book, and told all about Jack's home,
and the way to get to it? Have you a
Bible?"</p>

<p>"No," said Bud, slowly, "I haven't got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
no book at all. I never had no book."</p>

<p>What desolation of poverty was this!
Claire took her instant resolution.</p>

<p>"Bud, I have a Bible which I think little
Jack and little Jack's Saviour want me to
give to you for your very own. I'll get it
for you to-night, and then I want you to
promise me that every day you will read
one verse in it. It is all marked off into
verses&mdash;and will you begin to-night?"</p>

<p>"I will so," said Bud, with a note of
satisfaction in his voice. "I've thought a
good many times that it would be nice to
have one book; but I didn't much expect
to, ever. I'll read in it this very night,
ma'am."</p>

<p>And as he received the treasure wrapped
in paper, and, tucking it carefully under his
arm, trudged away, Claire, could she have
followed him, would have found that every
once in a while, during that long, homeward
walk, he chuckled, and hugged the
book closer.</p>

<p>Claire went to her room, and to her
knees, her heart full for Bud, poor, dreary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
homeless Bud! If he <i>could</i> be made to understand
that there were home and friends
waiting for him! If she had only had
time to mark a few of the verses, some of
those very plain ones, over the meaning of
which Bud could not stumble! She was
sorry that she had not retained the book
for a day and done this work. It was too
late now. She could only pray that God
would lead him toward the right verse.
To-morrow evening she would ask him for
his Bible, and on the Sabbath she would employ
her leisure moments in marking such
verses as he ought to know.</p>

<p>As she arose from her knees, a letter lying
on her table caught her eye. A home
letter, from Dora, with perhaps a few lines
in it from mamma herself. She seized it
like a hungry child, dropping on a hassock
before the fire to enjoy it. Four closely
written pages from Dora, crossed and re-crossed,
after the fashion of schoolgirls, who
seem to be provident only in the line of
note-paper.</p>

<p>Claire looked at it lovingly, and laid it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
aside to be enjoyed afterward. Here was a
scrap from mamma; only a few lines on a
half-sheet of paper; after these she dived.
Letters from Dora were delightful, and
could wait; the heart of the girl was homesick
for mamma.</p>

<p>It was over the last page of Dora's sheet
that she lingered the longest.</p>

<p>"I have not told you our piece of news,
yet. We have moved. We kept it a secret
from you, mamma and I, because we were
sure you would think that we could not
do such a thing without you; and as we
were well aware that the church at South
Plains could not spare you&mdash;to say nothing
of the school&mdash;we determined to take the
burdens of life upon our own shoulders,
and give you nothing to worry over, until
we were settled. It is done, and we are
alive and comfortable; so you may dismiss
those troubled wrinkles that I can distinctly
see gathering on your forehead.</p>

<p>"Now for the reason why: the same law
which seems of late to have taken possession
of us&mdash;necessity. The house you so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
deftly settled us in was sold, and three
weeks' notice given to renters. We could
have held them for a longer time, as Mr.
Winfield indignantly told us, and as we
very well knew, for you know how papa
held that house for the Jones family when
the owner said they must vacate. But
what was the use? Mamma said she would
rather move at once, than have any words
about it. So I felt, and one day when we
went out hunting the proper shade of curtain
for the church you own, we hunted
rooms also. Where do you think we found
them? Within a square of our old home!
In the Jenkins Block, you know. They
chanced to be vacant, because the former
occupants had bought a place on the
square, and gone to housekeeping on a
larger scale. The rent is the same as that
which we were paying. I think Mr. Cleveland
made his conscience somewhat elastic
in arranging it so, for, while the rooms are
smaller and less convenient than those we
vacated, you know what the neighborhood
is. However, he offered them on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
terms we were then paying, and of course
we could not demur. I urged the taking
of them at once, for mamma's sake; for,
though I think with you that the farther
we are away from the old home, the better,
and though I hate every spot within a mile
of our house, still I could see that mamma
did not share the feeling. There were old
friends for whose faces she pined. Good
old friends, you know, who love her for
herself, and not for the entertainments she
used to give. And then there was the old
church. I could see mamma's face brighten
over the thought of being there once more;
and though I hate that too, for mamma's
sake, I was glad that we listened to Dr.
Ellis again last Sabbath. We are comfortably
situated, though you know, better than
I can tell you, what a sort of mockery it
is of our former way of living; but for
mamma I think it will be better in every
way, and she is the one to be considered.
But I believe in my heart the dear woman
thinks I wanted to come, and imagines
that that is why she consented to the plan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
I hope she does. I never mean to let her
know how I grind my teeth over it all.
Not fiercely, Claire; I do try to be submissive,
and I know that God knows what is
best, and that papa is happy, and that I
must not wish him back; but the bearing
it is very bitter all the time.</p>

<p>"I am less like you even than I used to
be, and papa said I was to try to be more
like you.</p>

<p>"I wonder if one thing that I have to
tell will surprise you, or vex you, or whether
you will not care anything about it? I
have held my pen for a full minute to try
to decide, and I find that I don't know. It
is something that has hurt me cruelly, but
then I am easily hurt. I don't want to
make you feel as I do; but if you care,
you ought to know, and if you don't care,
no harm can come of my telling you.</p>

<p>"Claire, I used to think in the old days
that seem to have been fifty years ago, that
you liked Pierce Douglass rather better
than the other young men who used to be
so fond of coming to our home; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
thought&mdash;in fact, I felt almost certain&mdash;that
he liked you better than he did anybody
else. Well, he has returned; and
only yesterday I saw him on Clark Avenue.
I was just coming down Reubens street,
and I made all possible haste, because I
thought it would be so pleasant to see his
familiar face once more, and to answer his
many questions. Besides, I presume I was
silly, but I thought it more than probable
that he was in correspondence with you,
and would have some news of you to give
me. I called to him, breathlessly, as I saw
he was about to enter a car, and I thought
more than likely he was looking for our
address. 'Pierce,' I said, you know I have
called him Pierce ever since I was a little
bit of a girl, and he used to help me down
the seminary stairs. He stopped and looked
about him, and looked right at me, and
made no movement toward me, though I
was hastening to him. 'I am so glad to
see you,' I said, for even then I did not
understand. And then he spoke: 'Miss
Benedict, is it? Why, I was not aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that you were in the city. I thought I had
heard of a removal. I trust you are having
a pleasant winter, Miss Benedict. We have
a good deal of snow for this region, have
we not? You will pardon my haste; I had
signaled my car before you spoke.'</p>

<p>"And he lifted his hat, with one of his
graceful bows, and sprang in and was
gone. Yes, I pardoned his haste! I was
glad to see the car swing around the corner.
I was burning and choking. The
idea of being met in that way by Pierce
Douglass! Only six months since he called
me 'little Doralinda Honora,' and begged
me not to forget to mention his name ten
times a day while he was absent. Claire, I
could hardly get home, my limbs trembled
so. Mamma was out executing one of your
commissions, and I was glad, for I was not
fit to see her for hours.</p>

<p>"I have heard to-day that Pierce has
been in town for six weeks, and is to be
married in the spring to Emmeline Van
Antwerp. Is that any reason why he should
have insulted me? I am certainly willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
that he shall marry whom he pleases, if he
can secure her. Claire, do you remember
how Emmeline's taste in dress used to amuse
him? But she is very rich, you know; at
least, she is an only daughter, and her
father has not failed. How does Pierce
know but that in six months it will be Mr.
Van Antwerp's turn?</p>

<p>"Well, I only hope, dear Claire, that I
was utterly and entirely mistaken in your
friendship for that man. It seems to me
now that I must have been; for, with so
base a nature, he could not have interested
you.</p>

<p>"Oh, Claire, do you suppose papa knows
of all these little stings that we have to
bear? I can hardly see how he can be
happy in heaven if he does, for he guarded
us all so tenderly. Does that old worn-out
church really fill your heart as it seems to,
so that you can be happy without papa?
That is wicked, I know, and if you are
happy, I am glad you are. I do try to
shield mamma, and she is like you, meek
and patient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-night, dear! I am very weary of
this day. I am going to try to lose the
memory of it in sleep."</p>

<p>Claire rose up from reading this sheet,
with a pale face out of which the brightness
was strangely gone. It seemed a curious
thing to her afterward, that she had
thought to herself while reading it: "I am
glad I spoke those words to Bud; I am glad
I told him about a home where there is
nothing but brightness. We need such homes."</p>

<p>She went about with a slow step, setting
the little room to rights, arranging the fire
for the night; then she sat down and
worked over her class-book, arranging her
averages for the week. She had not meant
to do that work on that evening, but she
seized upon it as something that would
keep her thoughts employed. She did not
want to think.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of the figures, she
pushed the book from her, and burying
her face in her hands, said to her heart in
a determined way: "Now, what is the
matter? Why do I not want to look this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
thing in the face? What is wounded, my
pride?" After a little she drew a long, relieved
breath, and sat erect. There was
no need in covering this thing away; it
would bear looking at.</p>

<p>Dora had been both right and wrong.
She had liked him better, yes, quite a little
better than the other young men of her acquaintance.
She had believed in him. When
financial ruin came upon them, and friends
gathered around with well-meant, but often
blundering words of sympathy, she had comforted
herself with thinking how gracefully
Pierce Douglass would have said and done
these things had he been at home.</p>

<p>When the burden of life strained heavily
upon her, she had found herself imagining
how heartily he would have shouldered some
of the weights that another could carry, and
helped her through. She had not been in
correspondence with him. He had asked to
write to her, and she had, following her
father's gently-offered suggestion, assured him
that it would be better not; he was not to
be absent many months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet during these weeks at South Plains,
she had often told herself that perhaps
Pierce would write a line for friendship's
sake. He would know that a letter of sympathy
offered at such a time would be very
different from ordinary correspondence. Yet
when no letter came, she had told herself
that of course he would not write; he was
too thoroughly a gentleman to do so after
she had, though never so gently, refused to
receive his letters. Sometimes it was this
story, and sometimes she reminded herself
that of course he had not her address; he
would not like to inquire for it; there had
been nothing in their friendship to warrant
it; when he reached home, and met Dora
and her mother again, as he would assuredly,
she would be quite likely to get a little
message from him. Not a thought had
crossed her mind but that he would hasten
to the old friends to offer his earnest sympathy
and express his sorrow, for her father
had been a friend to him. Now here was
the end of it. Six weeks in town, and
nothing to say to Dora but a comment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
about the snow! If he had said ice, it
would have been more in keeping. Here
was a shattered friendship; and no true
heart but bleeds over such wounds.</p>

<p>Yet, and this was the decision which
made her lift her head again. There was
wounded pride, certainly, and wounded feeling;
but there was a sense in which it did
not matter how Pierce Douglass met her
sister on the street, or whom he married.
She had not known it before; there had
been a time when she had imagined it
otherwise; but something seemed to have
come into her life since her brief residence
in this little village, which made her clear-eyed.
She knew that she did not want to
marry a man like Pierce Douglass. She
knew that had he come to her, before the
revelations of this letter, and asked her to
share his name and home, she would have
been grateful and sorrowful, but she would
certainly have said, "I can not." She smiled
a little as she recurred to Dora's letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Had the old church won her heart? Surely
it could not be anything else in South
Plains! Yes, oh, yes, it was something that
she had found at South Plains; she had
been lifted up into daily fellowship with
the Lord. She was learning to live as
"seeing him who is invisible," and in the
light of his daily companionship she could
not come into close relationship with such
an one as Pierce Douglass, a man who did
not profess allegiance to him.</p>

<p>And yet, you who understand the intricacies
of the human heart will be able to
see how the letter had stung. She did not
want to marry him, but she wanted to respect
him, to look upon him as a friend;
to feel that he cared for her, and not for
her father's millions. It was bitter to feel
that here was yet another to whom friendship
had been only an empty name, and to
wonder how many more there were, and
because of him to have less faith in the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole, I think it was well that
at last she cried. They were healthy tears;
and helped to wash away some of the bitterness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>SPREADING NETS.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>THE morning found her her own quiet
self. Her first waking thoughts were
of Bud, and the first thing she did, after
her toilet was made, was to sit down and
study her Bible with a view to selecting
some verses that she meant to mark for
Bud.</div>

<p>All day she went about her many duties
with a quiet heart. Even the sting of a
false friendship seemed to have been taken
away. In the afternoon, she refused to ride
with Mr. Ansted, on the plea that she had
a music-lesson to give, but when the scholar
failed to appear, she, in nowise discomfited,
set herself to the answering of the home
letters. A long, genial letter to her mother;
longer than she had taken time for of late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
fuller of detail as to the work that occupied
hands and heart.</p>

<p>Something about Bud, his lonely life, his
one tender memory, her desire that he might
find a Friend who would never fail him;
her wish that the mother would remember
him when she prayed; her longing to be
in a faint sense a helper to him, as her
father would surely have been, were he on
the earth. "I cannot do for him what papa
would," so she wrote, "but Christ can do
much more; and it gives me a thrill of
joy to remember that he is not only in
heaven with papa, but here, watching for
Bud."</p>

<p>A detailed account of the last evening's
rehearsal, and the new recruits. A hint of
her desire to lead this restless Alice into
clearer light&mdash;if, indeed, the true Light had
ever shined into her heart. A word even
about Louis Ansted: "Would mamma pray
for him, too? It was said that he was in
danger from several sources, and he said that
his mother was not at all anxious about
him. If you were his mother," so she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
wrote, "you would be anxious. Be a mother
to him for Christ's sake, mamma dear, and
pray for him, as I am afraid his own mother
does not. Still, I ought not to say that,
for she is a member of the church, and it
may be that her son does not know her
heart."</p>

<p>To Dora there was but a scrap of paper:</p>

<p>"It is a pity, Doralinda dear, to put you
off with this little torn bit of paper, but I
have written all the news to mamma, which
means to you, too, of course, and this bit
is just large enough for the subject about
which I want to speak to you alone. Don't
worry, little sister, about me, nor about
Pierce Douglass' treatment of me or of you;
if his manliness can afford such a slight as
he gave you, we certainly can afford to
bear it. In a sense, it was hard; but much
harder, I should think, for him than for us.</p>

<p>"No, little Dora; the church here has
not my whole heart, though I will own that
a large piece of it has gone out to the
dreary little sanctuary so sadly in need of
a human friend&mdash;for the Lord will not do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
what his people ought to do, you know;
but I will tell you who is filling my heart,
and keeping me at rest and happy: the
Lord Jesus Christ. Not happy without
papa, but happy in the sure hope of meeting
him again, and never parting any more.
Don't you remember, dear, there can never
be another parting from papa? Some sorrowful
places there may be for your feet and
mine on our journey home; but so far as
papa is concerned, there will be no more
need for tears. Bear the thorns of the way,
little sister, in patience, for they are only
<i>on the way</i> through the woods; not a thorn
in the home.</p>

<p>"I trust you will be so brave as to dismiss
Pierce Douglass from your thoughts;
unless, indeed, you take the trouble to ask
him for what he will let us have some
handsome chairs for the pulpit! I remember
at this moment that his money is invested
in furniture. But perhaps you will not like
to do that, and he might not let us have
them at any lower rates than we could secure
elsewhere. Good-by, darling, brave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
lonely sister. I both laughed and cried over
your letter, though the tears were not about
the things you thought would move them."</p>

<p>She folded and addressed this letter with
a smile. No need to tell this sensitive fierce-hearted
Dora that the wound rankled for a
time, and did not bring tears only because
it was too deep for tears.</p>

<p>Yet assuredly her heart was not broken
over Pierce Douglass.</p>

<p>The letter sealed and laid aside, an unemployed
half-hour lay before her; not that
there was not plenty to do, but that curious
aversion to setting about any of it,
which busy workers so well understand, came
over her in full force. A sort of unreasonable
and unreasoning desire that the hour
might be marked by something special hovered
around her. She stood at the window
and looked out on the snow, and watched
the sleighs fly past. A sleigh-ride would be
pleasant. Why could she not have known
that her music-scholar was to disappoint her,
and so had the benefit of a ride?</p>

<p>Possibly she might have said a word in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
season to Louis Ansted, though there was
about her the feeling that he was not ready
for the word in season, and would make
poor use of it. Perhaps the Master knew
that it was better left unsaid, and so had
held her from the opportunity; but she
longed to do something.</p>

<p>A sleigh was stopping at the Academy.
The young man who sprang out and presently
pealed the bell, was Harry Matthews.
Did he want her? she wondered, and was
this her special opportunity? No, he only
wanted a roll of music, to study the part
which he was to sing; but on learning that
the teacher was in, and at leisure, he came
to her in the music-room, and asked questions
about this particular song, and about
the rehearsal, and asked to have the tenor
played for him, and as he bent forward to
turn the music, the breath of wine floated
distinctly to her. Was this an opportunity?
Was there something that she might say,
and ought to say?</p>

<p>It was Louis Ansted's belief that this
young man's special danger lay in this direction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
but what a delicate direction it was
to touch!</p>

<p>He thanked her heartily for the help
which she had given him about the difficult
part, and in that brief time her resolution
was taken:</p>

<p>"Now, do you know there is something
that I want you to do for me?"</p>

<p>No, he did not know it, but was delighted
to hear it. Miss Benedict was doing so
much for them all, that it would certainly
be a great pleasure to feel that he could in
any way serve her. He wished he could tell
her how much he and some of the other
boys appreciated this opportunity to study
music. There had never been any good singing
in South Plains before.</p>

<p>There was a flush on Claire's cheeks as
she replied, holding forward a little book at
the same time.</p>

<p>It <i>would</i> serve me. She could think of
scarcely anything else, so easily done, that
would give her greater pleasure than to have
him write his name on her pledgebook; she
had an ambition to fill every blank. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
was room for five hundred signers, and she
and her sister at home were trying to see
which could get their pledge-book filled
first. Would he give her his name?</p>

<p>And so, to his amazement and dismay,
was Harry Matthews brought face to face
with a total abstinence pledge. What an
apparently simple request to make! How
almost impossible it seemed to him to comply
with it!</p>

<p>He made no attempt to take the little
book, but stood in embarrassment before it.</p>

<p>"Isn't there anything else?" he said, at
last, trying to laugh. "I hadn't an idea
that you would ask anything of this sort.
I can't sign it, Miss Benedict; I can't really,
though I would like to please you."</p>

<p>"What is in the way, Mr. Matthews?
Have you promised your mother not to sign
it?"</p>

<p>The flush on his cheek mounted to his
forehead, but still he tried to laugh and
speak gayly.</p>

<p>"Hardly! my mother's petitions do not
lie in that direction. But I really am principled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
against signing pledges. I don't believe
in a fellow making a coward of himself
and hanging his manhood on a piece of
paper."</p>

<p>This was foolish. Would it do to let the
young fellow know that she knew it was?</p>

<p>"Then you do not believe in bonds, or
mortgages, or receipts, or promises to pay,
of any sort&mdash;not even bank-notes!"</p>

<p>He laughed again.</p>

<p>"That is business," he said.</p>

<p>"Well," briskly, "this is business. I will
be very business-like. What do you want
me to do, give you a receipt? Come, I
want your name to help fill my book, and
I am making as earnest a business as I
know how, of securing names."</p>

<p>"Miss Benedict, I am not in the least
afraid of becoming a drunkard."</p>

<p>"Mr. Matthews, that has nothing whatever
to do with the business in hand. What
I want is your name on my total abstinence
pledge. If you do not intend to be a
drinker, you can certainly have no objection
to gratifying me in this way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! but I have. The promise trammels
me unnecessarily and foolishly. I am often
thrown among people with whom it is
pleasant to take a sip of wine, and it does
no harm to anybody."</p>

<p>"How can you be sure of that? There
are drunkards in the world, Mr. Matthews;
is it your belief that they started out with
the deliberate intention of becoming such,
or even with the fear that they might? or
were they led along step by step?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know all that; but I assure you
I am very careful with whom I drink liquor.
There are people who seem unable to take
a very little habitually; they must either
let it alone, or drink to excess. Such people
ought to let it alone, and to sign a
pledge to do so. I never drink with any
such; and I never drink, any way, save
with men much older than I, who ought to
set me the example instead of looking to
me, and who are either masters of themselves,
or too far gone to be influenced by
anything that I might do."</p>

<p>Was there ever such idiotic reasoning!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
But the young man before her was very
young, and did not know his own heart,
much less understand human nature. He
was evidently in earnest, and would need
any amount of argument&mdash;would need, indeed,
a much better knowledge of himself&mdash;before
she could convince him of his false
and dangerous position; and her opportunity,
if it were one, was swiftly passing.
What was there that she could accomplish
here and now? Since he was in such a
state of bewilderment as to logic, she resolved
to lay a delicate little snare for his
feet.</p>

<p>"Well, I am sorry that you will not sign
my pledge. I do not like your arguments;
I think they are painfully weak. I wish at
your leisure you would look into them carefully,
and see if you think them worthy of
lodgment in an honest mind. But in the
meantime, there is something else. This
little favor that I am about to ask, will you
promise to grant?"</p>

<p>The young man looked immensely relieved.
He had not expected her to abandon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
ground so promptly; he had been on the
verge of pleading fear lest his horse was
restive, and so breaking away from the embarrassment.
He tumbled eagerly into the
pretty net. What could she ask that would
not be easy enough, now that the total abstinence
pledge was out of the way? He
could think of nothing else that a lady such
as Miss Benedict certainly was, could ask,
which would not be comparatively easy of
accomplishment.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in that way of doing
business," he said, looking wise, and smiling
down on her in a superior way. "As a rule,
I promise nothing with my eyes shut; but
I am sure to be able to trust you, and I
will try to do anything else that you ask
of me, if only to prove how sincere I am
in my desire to please."</p>

<p>"It is a very good rule, as a rule," she
said, quickly; "I would not violate it often;
but this is easy enough to do; I want your
signature to that."</p>

<p>She turned the leaves rapidly, and pointed
to a few lines in the back part of the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
book. Two signatures were appended;
but the astounding words that arrested the
young man's attention were these:</p>

<p>"I promise that within twenty-four hours
after I have taken a taste of anything that
will intoxicate, I will report the same, either
in person or by letter, to my friend, Miss
Benedict."</p>

<p>The hot blood spread all over the face
of the gay boy before her, as he read and
re-read this singular pledge.</p>

<p>"I am fairly caught," he said at last, in
a constrained voice, "and in a way that I
least expected. May I ask you what possible
good it can do you to burden yourself
with such senseless confidences as these?"</p>

<p>"You are right," she said, "they are confidences.
I should not have shown you the
book if I were not sure that the names
there are utterly unknown to you, and will
be likely always to remain so. I had a good
motive, and the effort resulted in good. So
much you must believe on trust. But I did
not mean to catch you&mdash;at least, not in the
way you mean&mdash;and to prove it, I will release<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
you from your promise. I judged from
what you told me that you would not consider
it a hard one."</p>

<p>She was speaking with cold dignity now.
She was willing that he should not sign
this pledge if he wished to be released. If
only his unwillingness to sign would lead
him to think on what dangerous ground he
stood, part of her object would have been
attained.</p>

<p>But no, his pride was roused now, and
came to the rescue. He refused to be released.
Since she chose to burden herself
in this way, he was quite willing, and
should certainly add his name. This he
did with a flourish, trying to be gay again,
and went away assuring her that he was
sorry for her, for he always kept a pledge.</p>

<p>After he was gone, she tormented herself
as to whether she had done wisely. She
was more than doubtful. Those two other
names had been written by friendless and
sorely-tempted boys, who distrusted themselves
and their resolutions to such an extent
that she had devised this little plan for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
helping them up from the depths of despair.
They were gone now, both of them, where
stronger arms than hers upheld them, where
they were forever safe from falling; and
Harry Matthews' knowledge of their names
could harm no one. But Harry was of a different
world. Had she been foolish in thus almost
stealing his promise? He had not taken it
as she had thought he would. She had believed
him to be gayly indifferent to his
habits in this direction; she had believed
that he was unaware how frequently he
accepted business invitations of this character.</p>

<p>On the whole, she was more than doubtful
as to the unusual work done in this
leisure half-hour, and looked with apprehension
rather than pleasure at the name
in her book. Nevertheless, she prayed over
it as she had been wont to do for those
who were gone now. There was nothing for
it but to ask Him who never made mistakes,
to overrule hers, if it was a mistake,
and use it in some way for his glory. This
rested her. It was so wonderful to remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that He could make even mistakes serve
him!</p>

<p>Meantime, Bud! The little lamp which
belonged to his quarters over the stable,
was left wholly to his care, and he did not
get the best. He often stumbled his way to
bed in the dark, rather than take the trouble
of filling the lamp in the daytime. But to-night,
with his treasure under his arm, he
rejoiced to remember that part of his morning
work had been to fill that lamp and put
it in unusual order. It was with satisfaction
that he lighted and set it on the inverted
barrel that he had improvised for a table.
He was to read a verse in a book!</p>

<p>He had little knowledge as to whether
the verses were long or short, whether it
would take until midnight or longer to read
one, and it had nothing to do with his
promise. He reflected that the lamp was
full, and resolved that as long as it would
burn he would work at the verse, if necessary.
But where to begin? What a big book
it was! If Clare had but marked a verse
for him as she had planned! Well, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
then? It would not have been likely to
have been the one over which he stopped
at random, and slowly spelled out, going
back over each word until he had the sentence
complete: "As one whom his mother
comforteth, so will I comfort you, and ye
shall be comforted in Jerusalem." What a
verse for poor, ignorant, blundering Bud!
Might it not as well have been in Greek?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>BUD IN SEARCH OF COMFORT.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>LET me tell you that sentences which
you believe will be as Greek to certain
souls, are sometimes fraught with wonderful
meaning, because of an illumination
about which you know nothing. It was so
with Bud.</div>

<p>Back in his memory of those bright days
when little Jack was still in the flesh, were
certain scenes standing out vividly. Little
Jack had a mother, a good, fat, motherly,
commonplace sort of woman, with no knowledge
of, or care for, Bud, beyond the fact
that she wanted him always to have enough
to eat and a comfortable place in which to
sleep, and was glad that little Jack liked
him so well, simply because it was a liking
that gave little Jack pleasure. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
all that she would have been to you; but
to Bud she would have served for his ideal
of an angel, had he known anything about
angels.</p>

<p>She was little Jack's mother, and she was
motherly, and Bud had never seen a motherly
woman before; perhaps, after all, you
get an idea of why she was glorified in his
eyes. His own mother slept in a neglected
grave, when Bud was five years old, but
after he came to live at little Jack's, he
had lain awake nights to think how she
would have looked, and acted, and spoken,
had she been alive. And she always looked
to him like this one motherly pattern. How
Bud longed for her, for the sound of her
voice, for the touch of her hand, only he
could have told you. Little Jack had been
in the habit of running to mother with every
disappointment, every grievance, every pain.
He had never been a healthy, rollicking, self-reliant
boy, but a gentle, tender one, to be
shielded and petted; and Bud had heard
again and again and <i>again</i> these words,
spoken oh! so tenderly, that the memory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
them now often brought the tears: "Poor
little Jack! mother will comfort him!" and
the words were accompanied with a gesture
that framed itself in Bud's heart&mdash;the enveloping
of little Jack's frail form within two
strong motherly arms, suggestive to the boy
of boundless power and protectiveness. Could
words better fitted to meet Bud's heart have
been marked in his Bible? Would Claire
Benedict have been likely to have marked
that particular verse for him?</p>

<p>It is a truth that a certain class of Christian
workers need to ponder deeply, that
when we have done our best, according to
the measure of our opportunities, we may
safely leave the Holy Spirit to supplement
our work.</p>

<p>The next morning, Bud thoughtfully rubbed
the shining coats of the horses, his
mind awake and busy with a new problem.
What did the verse mean, that he had read
so many times, that now it seemed to glow
before him on the sun-lighted snow? He had
wakened in the night and wondered. What
<i>could</i> it mean? Not that he did not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
some of it; he was too unenlightened
to imagine that plain words could mean
other than they said.</p>

<p>It had not so much as occurred to him
that, because they were in the Bible, they
must necessarily have some obscure meaning
utterly foreign to what they appeared to
say.</p>

<p>Such logic as that is only the privilege
of certain of the educated classes! Bud
knew then, what some of the sentence
meant. Somebody was to be comforted by
somebody, and the way it was to be done
was as a mother would do, and Bud, because
of little Jack in heaven, knew how
that was. Oh, little Jack! living your short
and uneventful life here below, and oh!
commonplace, yes, somewhat narrow-minded
mother! bestowing only the natural instincts
of the mother-heart on your boy&mdash;both of
you were educating a soul for the King's
palace, and you knew it not!</p>

<p>How wonderful will the revelations of
heaven be, when certain whose lives have
touched for a few days and then separated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
shall meet, in some of the cycles of eternity,
and talk things over!</p>

<p>Who but the Maker of human hearts
could have planned Bud's education in this
way?</p>

<p>Well, he knew another thing. The Comforter
promised must be Jesus; for had not
<i>she</i>, that only other one who had spoken to
him in disinterested kindness, said that Jesus,
the same Jesus who had been so much to
little Jack, was waiting for him, and wanted
him to come up to heaven where Jack
was? And if Jesus could do such great
things for Jack, and really wanted <i>him</i>
could he not plan the way? Bud believed
it. To be shown the way to reach such a
place as Jack told of, and to be made
ready to enter there when he should reach
the door, would certainly be comfort enough.
He could almost imagine that One saying to
the little hurts by the way: "Never mind,
Bud; it will be all right by and by." That
was what the mother used cheerily to say
sometimes to little Jack, and the verse
read, "as one whom his mother comforteth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
You see how the photographs of his earlier
years were educating Bud.</p>

<p>But there was one thing shrouded in obscurity.
This "comforting" was to be done
at Jerusalem. Now what and where was
Jerusalem? Poor Bud! he had "never had
no book," you will remember, and his knowledge
of geography was limited indeed. He
knew that this village which had almost
bounded his life was named South Plains;
and he knew that back in the country
among the farms was where little Jack had
lived, and he knew the name of the city
that lay in the opposite direction; none of
these were Jerusalem. Bud did not know,
however, but that the next city, or town,
or even farming region might answer to that
name, and might be the spot to which
those who would have comfort were directed.
Little Jack might have lived there, for aught
that he knew; they came from some other
place to the farm, Miss Benedict might be
from there, in which case she would know
how to direct him! I want you to take
special notice of one thing. It lay clear as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
sunlight in the boy's ignorant mind. <i>To Jerusalem
he meant to go.</i> And as to time:
just as soon as he possibly could, he should
start. As to how he should manage by the
way, or what he should do after he reached
that country, he made no speculations; the
road was too dark for that. All that he
was sure of was that he would <i>start</i>.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't miss of little Jack for anything,"
he said, rubbing with energy; "and
as for the 'comforting,' if that can be for
me&mdash;and she said so&mdash;why, I'd go till I
dropped, to find it."</p>

<p>A clear voice broke in on his thoughts:</p>

<p>"Bud, mamma wants the light carriage
and the pony to be ready to take her to the
12.20 train."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Bud, and he had as yet
not a thought of saying anything else.</p>

<p>But Miss Alice lingered and watched the
rubbing; not that she was interested in that,
or, indeed, was thinking about it at all. She
was watching Bud, and thinking of him.
What did Claire Benedict find in him to interest
her? What did she suppose that she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Alice Ansted, could do to help him? The
idea seemed fully as absurd as it had when
first suggested.</p>

<p>As if the boy had an idea above the horse
he was rubbing so carefully! He did not
look as intelligent as the animal. She had
often wondered what the horses thought
about, as they trotted along. What did Bud
think about as he rubbed? Did he think
at all?</p>

<p>"You seem to like that work?"</p>

<p>It was Miss Alice's voice again. It startled
Bud, the tone was so gentle, as though
possibly she might be saying the words to
comfort him. He dropped the brush with
which he had been working; but as he
stooped to pick it up, answered respectfully,</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Alice's lip curled. The idea of Miss
Benedict trying to interest her in a boor
like that, who could not reply to the merest
commonplace without growing red in the
face and blundering over his work! She
turned to go. She could not think of anything
else to say, and if she could, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
use to say it? But in that one moment of
time, Bud had taken his resolution. The
voice had been kind; its echo lingered
pleasantly; he would summon all his courage
and ask the question which was absorbing
his thoughts. It might be days before
he could see Miss Benedict again, and
he could not wait.</p>

<p>"Miss Ansted," he said, and she noticed
that his voice trembled, "would you tell me
one thing that I want to know right away?"</p>

<p>"That depends," she answered lightly;
"I may not know. However, if your question
is not too deep, I may try to answer
it. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Why, I've got to know <i>right away</i>
where Jerusalem is."</p>

<p>"Jerusalem!" she repeated. "Why on
earth do you wish to know that? I don't
know myself, precisely. It is across the
ocean somewhere in Asia, you know. Why
do you care, Bud, where it is?"</p>

<p>"I've got to go there," said Bud, with
simple dignity.</p>

<p>Miss Ansted's laugh rang out merrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is an undertaking!" she said,
gayly. "When do you intend to start? and
what is the object of the journey, I wonder?"
She felt sure now that Bud was little
less than an idiot.</p>

<p>But Bud had another question to ask.
His face was grave, almost dismayed. "Across
the ocean!" That sentence appalled. He
had heard of the ocean, and of a storm on
it, and a shipwreck. A wandering sailor
once told in his hearing a fearful story of
wreck and peril. Yet, be it recorded that
the boy, though appalled, did not for one
moment recede from his fixed resolved to start,
and go as far as he could. That Comforter
he meant to find. It had taken such hold
of his heart that he knew he could never
give it up again. This was his next timidly-put
question:</p>

<p>"Did you ever go there, Miss Ansted?"</p>

<p>"I never did," she answered, laughing
still, and very curious now to know what
queer project poor Bud had on his mind.
"Why do you want to go, Bud?"</p>

<p>The answer was direct and grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to go after Him who said He
would comfort me. 'Ye shall be comforted
in Jerusalem,' that is what it says, and <i>she</i>
said it meant me, and little Jack went, I
make sure, and I mean to go. I <i>must</i> go."</p>

<p>But before that answer, Alice Ansted stood
dumb. She had never been so amazed in her
life! What did the fellow mean? What
could have so completely turned his foolish
brain? "If this is the outcome of Miss
Benedict's efforts, she ought to know it at
once, before the poor idiot concludes his
career in a lunatic asylum."</p>

<p>This was her rapid thought, but aloud she
said, at last:</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking
about, Bud. You have some wild idea that
does not seem to be doing you any good.
I would advise you to drop it and think
about the horses; they are your best friends."</p>

<p>"I can't drop it," said Bud, simply; "I
read the verse in the Bible; I promised I
would, and I did, and I know all about it,
and I want to have it; <i>she</i> said it was for
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the verse?" and Miss Alice sat
down on a carriage-stool to listen.</p>

<p>Bud repeated with slow and solemn emphasis
the words which were now so familiar
to his ear: "As one whom his mother
comforteth, so will I comfort you: and ye
shall be comforted in Jerusalem."</p>

<p>"I know about mothers," he explained.
"There was little Jack's mother, and she
used to say to him just that, 'Mother will
comfort you,' and she did. And this one I
make sure is Jesus, because <i>she</i> said he
wanted me to go where little Jack is, and I
guess he means me, because I feel as if he
did, and I'm going to Jerusalem, if it is
across two oceans."</p>

<p>Evidently his heart gathered strength as
he talked; his voice grew firmer, and the
dignity of a fixed resolve began to settle on
his face.</p>

<p>Was there ever a more bewildered young
lady than this one who sat on the carriage
stool? She surveyed Bud with the sort of
half-curious, half-frightened air, which she
might have bestowed on a mild maniac whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
wanderings interested her. What was she
to say to him? How convince him of his
queer mistake?</p>

<p>"That doesn't mean what you think it does,
Bud," she began at last.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't it?" Bud asked, quickly;
almost as one would speak who was holding
on to a treasure which another was trying
to snatch from him.</p>

<p>"Because it doesn't. It has nothing to
do with the city named Jerusalem. It is
about something that you don't understand.
It has a spiritual meaning; and of course
you don't understand what I mean by that!
I haven't the least idea how to explain it
to you, and indeed, it is extremely unnecessary
for you to know. You see, Bud, it
means something entirely beyond your comprehension,
and has nothing whatever to do
with you."</p>

<p>Bud made not the slightest attempt at
answer, but went stolidly on with his work.
And Alice sat still and surveyed him for a
few minutes longer, then arose and shook
out her robes, and said, "So I hope you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
will not start for Jerusalem yet awhile,"
and laughed, and sped through the great,
sliding doors, and picked her way daintily
back to luxury, leaving the world blank for
Bud.</p>

<p>Miss Ansted was wise about the world,
and about books; surely she would know
whether the verse meant him, and whether
the word Jerusalem meant <i>Jerusalem</i>. Was
it all a mistake?</p>

<p>The pony was brought forward now and
had her share of rubbing and careful handling,
and a bit of petting now and then,
though the conversation which generally went
on between her and the worker was omitted
this morning. Bud had graver thoughts.
While he worked he went over the old
memories. Little Jack, and the comforting
mother, and the facts connected with those
experiences, no need to tell him that <i>they</i>
did not mean what they appeared to his
eyes; he knew better. Then there were the
plain, simple words standing like a solid
wall of granite: "As one whom his mother
comforteth, so will I comfort you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand around!" said Bud, in a tone of
authority; and while the gray pony obeyed,
he told her his resolve: "Them words
mean <i>something</i>, Dolly, and <i>she</i> knows
what they mean, and Bud is going to find
out."</p>

<p>You are not to suppose that the pronoun
referred to Alice Ansted. She had said
that she could not tell him what they
meant.</p>

<p>If anybody had been looking on with wide-open
eyes, it would have been an interesting
study in Providence to watch how Bud
was led. It was Alice Ansted who had a
very little hand in it again, though she
knew nothing of it. The "leading" was
connected, too, with so insignificant a matter
as an umbrella.</p>

<p>Mr. Ramsey had overtaken Louis Ansted
in a rain-storm, a few days before, and had
insisted on lending his umbrella, and it
suited Louis Ansted's convenience to direct
that it be sent home by Bud that morning.</p>

<p>Why Alice Ansted took the trouble to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
herself to Bud with the order, instead of
sending a servant, she hardly knew, neither
did she understand why, after having given
it, she should have lingered to say:</p>

<p>"I presume, Bud, that Mr. Ramsey can
answer all the questions about Jerusalem that
you choose to ask."</p>

<p>Now Mr. Ramsey was the dreary minister
who seemed to Claire Benedict to have
no life nor heart in any of his work.</p>

<p>Bud stood still to reflect over this new
thought suggested to him with a half-laugh.
He did not think to thank Miss Alice, and
yet he knew that he was glad. It was true,
the minister would be likely to know all
about it, and there might not be a chance
to speak to Miss Benedict again, and Bud
felt that he could not wait. So, as he
trudged off down the carriage-drive, he took
his resolution. He had never spoken a word
to a minister in his life, but he would ask
to see him this morning, and find out about
Jerusalem if he could.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>COMFORTED.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>SATURDAY morning, and the minister
in his dingy study struggling with an
unfinished sermon. Struggling with more
than this&mdash;with an attempt to keep in the
background certain sad and startling facts
that his meat bill was growing larger, and
that his last quarter's salary was still unpaid;
that his wife was at this moment
doing some of the family washing which
illness had prevented her from accomplishing
before, and taking care of two children
at the same time; that his Sunday coat
was growing hopelessly shabby, and there
was nothing in his pocket-book wherewith to
replace it with a new one; that the children
needed shoes, and there was no money
to buy them; that his wife was wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
herself out with over-work and anxiety, and
he was powerless to help it; that his people
were absorbed in their farms, and stores,
and shops, and cared little for him, or for
the truths which he tried to present. What
a spirit in which to prepare a sermon for
the Sabbath that was hurrying on!</div>

<p>The study was dingy from force of necessity.
The carpet was faded, and worn in
places into positive holes; the table-spread
was faded, because it had been long worn,
and was cheap goods and cheap colors in
the first place. Everything about him was
wearing out, and the old-young minister felt
that he was wearing out, too, years before
his time. I do not know that it is any
wonder that he frowned when he heard the
knock at the side door. It was nearly Saturday
noon; he had not time for loiterers,
yet he must answer that knock; thus much
he could save his wife. He threw down his
pen, with which he had just written the
half-formed sentence, "the inexorable and
inscrutable decrees of God," and went to
the door to admit Bud, and the umbrella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Not much need for delay here, and yet
Bud lingered. The umbrella had been set
aside, and the minister had said it was no
matter that it had not been brought before,
and still Bud did not go. He held his hat
in his hand, and worked with nervous fingers
at the frayed band around it, and at
last, summoning all his courage, dashed into
the centre of his subject:</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, will you tell me where
Jerusalem is?"</p>

<p>"Jerusalem!" repeated the minister, and
he was even more astonished than Alice
Ansted had been; but he looked into Bud's
eager, wistful face, and saw there something,
he did not understand what, which made
him throw the door open wider, and say,
"Come in;" and almost before he knew
what he was doing, he had seated Bud in
the old arm-chair by the stove, in the study,
and was sitting opposite him.</p>

<p>You don't expect me, I hope, to describe
that interview? There have been many like
it, in degree, all over the world, but nothing
quite so strange had ever come to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
minister before. Actually a hungry soul
looking for the Jerusalem above, about which
he, the minister, had read that morning,
with bated breath and an almost rebellious
longing to be there, where "there shall be
no more death, neither sorrow nor crying,
neither shall there be any more pain, for
the former things are passed away."</p>

<p>It was not difficult to show Bud the way.
He was like a child who heard with wide-open
wondering eyes, and for the first time,
the astounding fact that the Jerusalem toward
which his eyes were turned was near
at hand; that there was no ocean to cross,
no dangerous journey to take; it was simply
to put forth the hand and accept the
free gift.</p>

<p>I pause, pen in hand, to wonder how I
can make plain to you that this is no made-up
story; that Bud is a real character who
lives and does his work in the world to-day.
It is so natural in reading what people call
fiction, to turn from the book with a little
sigh, perhaps, and say: "Oh, yes; that is
all very well in a <i>book</i>, but in real life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
things do not happen in this way; and
there are no people so ignorant as that
Bud, anyway." But some of us do not write
fiction; we merely aim to present in compact
form before thoughtful people, pictures
of the things which are taking place all
around them. Bud did live, and <i>does</i> live;
and he was just so ignorant, and he did
hear with joy the simple, wonderful story
of the way to the Jerusalem of his desires,
and he did plant his feet firmly on the narrow
road, and walk therein.</p>

<p>I want to tell you what that minister did
after the door had been closed on Bud for
a few minutes. He walked the floor of his
limited study with quick, excited steps, three
times up and down, then he dropped on
his knees and prayed this one sentence,
"Blessed be the Lord God, who only doeth
wondrous things!" Then he went out to
the kitchen, and kissed his wife, and made
up the fire under her wash-boiler, and filled
two pails with water, and carried Johnnie
away and established him in a high-chair in
the study, with pencil and paper and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
picture-book; and then he took the five
sheets of that sermon over which he had
been struggling, and tore them in two, and
thrust them, decrees and all, into the stove!
Not that he was done with the decrees, or
that he thought less of them than before;
but a miracle had just been worked in his
study, and he had been permitted to be the
connecting link in the wondrous chain through
which ran the message to a new-born soul,
and the decree which held him captive just
then was that one in which the Eternal
God planned to give his Son to save the
world. And he was so glad that this decree
was inexorable, that its inscrutability
did not trouble him at all. I am glad that
he made up that fire, and filled those water-pails,
and, busy as he had need to be, gave
some gentle attention to Johnnie. A religious
uplifting which does not bubble over
into whatever practical work the heart or
the hands find to do, is not apt to continue.</p>

<p>It was on the following Sabbath that Miss
Benedict found opportunity to offer to mark
the verses in Bud's Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bud," she said, stopping at the bell-rope
where he tolled the bell, "if you will let me
take your Bible after church&mdash;did you bring
it with you? Well, if you will let me take
it, I will mark some verses in it that I
think will help you. Did you read a verse
each day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes'm," said Bud, and there was
that in his voice which made her turn and
look closely at him. "I read it, and I found
out the way, and I went and spoke to Him,
and He took me right in, as He said He
would, and there's no comfort like it, I'm
sure. I don't miss little Jack's mother any
more."</p>

<p>What did all this mean? Bud began in
the middle of things, according to his wont.
He forgot that Miss Benedict had heard
nothing about the promised comfort in Jerusalem,
nor the difficulties he had had in
being shown into the right way. Yet there
is something in the family language, however
awkwardly used, that conveys a meaning to
those of the same household.</p>

<p>"Bud, do you really mean that you went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
to Jesus Christ, and he gave you comfort?"</p>

<p>"I do that, ma'am," said Bud, with hearty
voice and shining eyes, and he gave the
bell-rope a vigorous pull. "He was right
by my side all the time, the minister said,
when I bothered so about crossing the ocean,
and there wasn't any ocean to cross; and I've
got the comfort, and I'm going to hear the
singing that you told about. I didn't think
I ever could, but now I know the way."</p>

<p>Claire turned away silently, and walked
softly into church, awed. Had poor Bud
really met the Lord in the way? It looked
so. She need have no more regrets over
those unmarked verses. But how wonderful
it was! And that is just the truth, dear,
half-asleep Christian; wonders are taking place
all about you, and it is possible that you
are merely engaged in trying to prove to
yourself and others that "the age of miracles
is past;" though why you should be
very anxious to prove it, does not clearly
appear even to yourself.</p>

<p>The minister, who preached that morning,
was the same minister who had stood behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
that desk and read his sermons to that people
for seven years, though some of his
hearers rubbed their eyes, and looked about
them in a dazed way, and wondered if this
<i>could</i> be so. What had happened to the
man? He had not a scrap of paper before
him. In the estimation of some, he did not
preach. Mrs. Graves, who read sermons aloud
at home on Sabbath afternoons, and was inclined
to be literary, said that it was not a
<i>sermon</i> at all&mdash;that it was just a talk. But
Deacon Graves, who was not literary, replied:</p>

<p>"Well, if he should take to talking very
often, we should all have to wake up and
look after our living, for it pretty nigh upset
everything we have done this good while,
and I must say it kind of made me feel as
though I should like to see something stirring
somewhere."</p>

<p>None of them knew about the minister's
uplifting, only Bud, and Bud did not know
that it was an uplifting, or that the minister
cared, or that the sermon had anything
to do with him, or, for that matter, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
was any different from usual. Bud knew <i>he</i>
was different, and it gave him the most intense
and exquisite joy to discover that he
understood nearly every word that the minister
said; but this he attributed not to a change
in the sermon, but because he had fairly
started on his journey to the heavenly Jerusalem.
It is possible that some listeners need
that sort of uplifting before the sermons to
which they appear to listen will ever be other
than idle words.</p>

<p>Yes, there was one other who knew that
a strange and sweet experience had come to
the disheartened minister. That was his wife.
She had known it ever since he came and
kissed her, and made up that fire, and filled
those pails. The kiss would have been very
precious to her without the other, but the
human heart is such a strange bit of mechanism,
that I shall have to confess to you,
that in the light of that new-made fire, the
tenderness glowed all day.</p>

<p>And now the preparations for the concert
went on with rapid strides. The Ansteds
slipped into the programme almost before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
realized it, and were committed to this and
that chorus and solo, and planned and rearranged
and advised with an energy that
surprised themselves.</p>

<p>It has been intimated to you that opportunities
for enjoying good music were rare
at South Plains.</p>

<p>What musical talent they possessed had
lain dormant, and the place was too small to
attract concert singers, so an invitation to
a musical entertainment came to the people
with all the charm of novelty. Of course,
the girls took care that the invitations should
be numerous and cordial. In fact, for three
weeks before the eventful evening, almost
the sole topic of conversation, even in the
corner grocery, had been the young folks'
concert and the preparations that were making.</p>

<p>Still, after taking all these things into consideration,
both the girls and their leader
were amazed, when at last the hour arrived,
to discover that every available inch of
room in the stuffy little church was taken.</p>

<p>"For once in its life it is full!" announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Anna Graves, peeping out, and then
dodging hastily back. "Girls, it is full to
actual suffocation, I should think; and they
have come to hear us sing. Think of it!"</p>

<p>Well, whether those girls astonished themselves
or not, they certainly did their fathers
and mothers. Indeed, I am not sure
that their young teacher did not feel an
emotion of surprise over the fact that they
acquitted themselves so well. Their voices,
when not strained in attempting music too
difficult for them, had been found capable
of much more cultivation than she had at
first supposed, and she had done her best
for them, without realizing until now how
much that "best" was accomplishing. It was
really such a success, and, withal, such a
surprise, that some of the time it was hard
to keep back the happy tears. It is true
there was one element in the entertainment
which the teacher did not give its proper
amount of credit. The fact is, she had so
long been accustomed to her own voice as
to have forgotten that to strangers it was
wonderful. I suppose that really part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
charm of her singing lay in the simplicity
of the singer. Her life had been spent in
a city, where she came in daily contact
with grand and highly cultivated voices, and
she, therefore, gauged her own as simply
one among many, and a bird could hardly
have appeared less conscious of his powers
than did she.</p>

<p>Not so her audience. They thundered
their delight until again and again she was
obliged to appear, and each time she sang
a simple little song or hymn, suited to the
musical capacities of the audience, so that
she but increased their desire for more.</p>

<p>It was all delightful. Yet really, sordid
beings that they were, I shall have to admit
that the crowning delight was when
they met the next morning, tired, but happy,
and counted over their gains, and looked in
each other's faces, and exclaimed, and
laughed, and actually cried a little over the
pecuniary result.</p>

<p>"Girls," said Miss Benedict, her eyes
glowing with delight, "we can carpet the
entire aisles. Think of that!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Then began work.</p>

<p>"Since we haven't been doing anything
for the last two months," said Mary Burton,
with a merry laugh, "I suppose we
can have the privilege of going to work
now."</p>

<p>Meantime, the days had been moving
steadily on. Christmas holidays had come
and gone, and the boys, as well as the girls,
to whom the holiday season had been apt to
be a time of special dissipation and temptation,
had been tided safely over it by reason
of being so busy that they had no
time for their usual festivities. The vacation
to which Claire Benedict had looked
forward with sad heart, on her first coming
to South Plains, because it would be a
time when she might honorably go home if
she could afford it, and she knew she could
not, had come and passed, and had found
her in such a whirl of work, so absorbed
from morning until night, as to have time
only for postals for the mother and sister.</p>

<p>"When the rush of work is over," so she
wrote, "I will stop for repairs, and take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
time to write some respectably lengthy letters,
but just now we are so overwhelmed
with our desire to get the church ready for
Easter Sunday that we can think of nothing
else. Mamma, I do wish you and Dora
could see it now, and again after it emerges
from under our hands!"</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter with her?" asked
Dora, and then mother and daughter laughed.
It was impossible to be very dreary with
those breezy postals constantly coming from
Claire. It was impossible not to have an
almost absorbing interest in the church at
South Plains, and think of, and plan for it
accordingly.</p>

<p>"Mamma," Dora said, after having read
the latest postal, as she sat bending it into
various graceful shapes, "I suppose that
church down on the beach that the girls of
our society are working for, looks something
like the one at South Plains. I think I
will join that society after all; I suppose I
ought to be doing something, since Claire
has taken up the repairing of old churches
for a life-business."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>This last with a little laugh, and the
mother wrote to Claire a few days later:</p>

<p>"Your sister has finally succeeded in
overcoming her dislike to joining the benevolent
society again, and is becoming interested
in their work. They have taken
up that seaside church again which you
were going to do such nice things for, you
know. Dora has felt all the time that
there was nothing for her to do now, because
we are poor, and has held aloof, but
yesterday she joined the girls, and brought
home aprons to make for the ready-made
department of Mr. Stevenson's store. The
plan is that Mr. Stevenson shall furnish
shades for the church windows at cost, and
the girls are to pay him by making up
aprons for that department. I am glad for
anything that rouses Dora; not that she is
bitter, but she is sad, and feels herself useless.
My dear, you are doing more than
repairing the church at South Plains; you
are reaching, you see, away out to the seaside."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>BUD AS A TEACHER.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT became a matter of astonishment to
discover how many friends the old church
had, and from what unexpected quarters
they appeared.</div>

<p>It really seemed as though each worker
had an uncle, or brother, or cousin, of whom
she had not given a thought in this connection,
who yet grew interested and offered
help.</p>

<p>It was Anna Graves who started this
special form of help, by an announcement
that she made one morning:</p>

<p>"Girls, what do you think! My uncle
Will is coming to stay two weeks, and he
says he will fresco the church ceiling for us,
if we will be content with plain work that
he can do rapidly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not take the eager listeners long
to promise to be content with the very
plainest work that could be imagined. Their
imagination had not thought of reaching after
frescoed ceilings.</p>

<p>"That is an idea!" said Nettie Burdick.
"I wonder if Joe and Charlie would not
help us?"</p>

<p>Now Joe and Charlie were wall-paperers
in the city; and it was only a few days
thereafter that Nettie announced with great
satisfaction that they would come out and
paper the old church, for their share in the
good work.</p>

<p>Then came Ruth Jennings' brother-in-law who
was in business in a more distant city,
and having called for Ruth and waited for
her on the evening when that perplexing
question of window-shades was being discussed,
he volunteered a delightful bit of information:</p>

<p>"Didn't they know about the new paper
in imitation of stained glass? So good an imitation
that when well laid it would take an
expert to distinguish the difference."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>No, indeed, they had never heard of such
a thing; and all other business was suspended
while the brother-in-law was plied
with questions, the conclusion of the matter
being that he said "their firm" dealt quite
largely in this new invention, and he could
have enough for this little church supplied
at cost, if they would like to go into it.
And being able to give in round numbers
the probable cost, the girls gleefully voted
to "go into it," provided they could secure
any person who knew how to manage it.
This at once developed further resources belonging
to the brother-in-law. He knew all
about it, and would lay the paper for them
with pleasure, if some of the "fellows" would
help. He would just as soon spend a day
in that way as not.</p>

<p>"Stained-glass windows!" said Ruth Jennings,
with a long-drawn sigh of satisfaction.
"As if South Plains had ever dreamed
of attaining to such heights! Girls, <i>will</i> the
old red curtains do for dusters, do you believe,
if we wash them tremendously?"</p>

<p>The very next day brought them another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
surprise. Miss Benedict read part of a
letter from "mamma," wherein it appeared
that a certain Mr. Stuart, of the firm of
Stuart, Greenough &amp; Co., had become interested
in the church at South Plains,
through Dora's reports of what absorbed her
sister's energies, and in grateful remembrance
of certain helps which Claire's father
had given their church in its struggling infancy,
he had selected a walnut desk and
two pulpit chairs, which he had taken the
liberty to ship to Miss Claire Benedict, with
his kind regards and earnest wish that her
efforts might be prospered, even as her father's
had been before her.</p>

<p>Over this astonishing piece of news some
of the girls actually cried. The pulpit desk
and chairs had represented a formidable bill
of expense looming up before them.</p>

<p>Each had been privately sure that they
would be obliged at last to take those which
would jar on their esthetic tastes, out of
respect to the leanness of the church purse.
And here was solid walnut, selected by a
man of undoubted taste and extensive knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
in this direction. I don't think it
strange that they cried!</p>

<p>Mary Burton, while she wiped her eyes,
made a remark which was startling to some
of the girls:</p>

<p>"How much your father has done for us
this winter!" and she looked directly at
Claire Benedict. Didn't Mary remember that
the dear father was dead?</p>

<p>But Miss Benedict understood. Her eyes
which had remained bright with excitement
until then, suddenly dimmed; but her smile
and her voice were very sweet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary! thank you!" was all she said.</p>

<p>Among the workers it would have been
hard to find one more faithful or more energetic
than Bud. He was full of eager,
happy life. Much depended upon him. He
could blacken stoves with the skill of a
professional, and none were ever more vigorously
rubbed than those rusty, ash-be-strewn
ones which had so long disgraced the church.
It had been good for Bud to have others
awaken to the fact that there were certain
things which he could do, and do well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>An eventful winter this was to him. Having
made an actual start toward Jerusalem,
it was found that he put more energy into
the journey than many who had been long
on the way; and, as a matter of course,
before long it became apparent that he was
taking rapid strides.</p>

<p>Miss Alice Ansted was among the first to
realize it. She came to Claire one evening
with embarrassed laughter, and a half-serious,
half-amused request for instruction:</p>

<p>"I'm trying to follow out some of your
hints, and they are getting me into more
trouble than anything I ever undertook.
Sewing societies and charity parties are as
nothing in comparison. I am trying to
teach Bud! He wants to study arithmetic;
it is an absurd idea, I think; what will he
ever want of arithmetic? But he was determined,
and you were determined, and between
you I have been foolish enough to
undertake it, and now it appears that arithmetic
is a very small portion of what he
wants to learn. He wants to know everything
that there is in the Bible; and where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
church-members get their ideas about all
sorts of things, and what the ministers study
in the theological seminary, and why all
the people in the world don't attend prayer-meeting,
and I don't know what not! He
acts as though his brain had been under a
paralysis all his life, which had just been
removed. I must say he astonishes me with
his questions; but it is easier to <i>ask</i> questions
than it is to answer them. What, for
instance, am I to say to ideas like these?
Since you have gotten me into this scrape,
it is no more than fair that you should
help me to see daylight."</p>

<p>And then would follow a discussion, nearly
always pertaining to some of the practical
truths of the Christian life, or to some direction
that Bud had found in the course
of his daily Bible verse, which seemed to
him at variance with the life which was
being lived by the professing Christians
about him, and which he turned to his
arithmetic-teacher to reconcile.</p>

<p>Bud, being ignorant, found it impossible
to understand why people who professed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
take the Bible for their rule of life, did not
follow its teachings, and he brought each
fresh problem to Alice Ansted with such
confident expectation that she knew all about
it, that she, who had only volunteered to
explain to him the rules of arithmetic, was
in daily embarrassment. From these conversations,
which constantly grew more close
and searching as Bud stumbled on new
verses, Claire Benedict used to turn with a
smile of satisfaction, as well as with almost
a feeling of awe, over the wisdom of the
Great Teacher. Alice Ansted might be
teaching Bud the principles of arithmetic,
but he was certainly daily teaching her the
principles of the religion which she professed,
but did not <i>live</i>.</p>

<p>In fact, others beside Alice Ansted were
being taught, or, at least, were being roused,
by the newly-awakened mind. The minister
had by no means forgotten the visit which
had glorified the study for that day, and
he was still bathing his almost discouraged
heart in the brightness of its memory, when
a vigorous knock one morning again interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
his studies. His eyes brightened
when he saw that the visitor was Bud, and
he invited him in with cordial tone. But
no, Bud was in haste. There was not a
trace of the hesitancy and embarrassment
which had characterized his first visit. He
spoke with the confidence of one who had
obtained great and sufficient help at this
source before, and who knew that it was
the place where help could be found.</p>

<p>"I haven't any time this morning," he said,
speaking with a rapidity which had begun
to characterize his newly awakened life.
"I'm down at Snyder's, waiting for the pony to
be shod, and there is a fellow there talking.
He says the Bible ain't true; that it is just
a lot of made-up stories to cheat women and
children and folks that don't know nothing,
like me. Well, now, I <i>know</i> that it is no
such a thing. I know the Bible is true,
because I've tried it; but he hasn't tried it,
you see, sir, and he won't because he don't
believe in it, and I thought I would just run
up here and ask you to give me something
to show him that it is all true; something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
that I can tell him in a hurry, because the
pony will be ready in a few minutes."</p>

<p>What in the world was that minister to
say? Was ever such an embarrassing question
thrust at him?</p>

<p>The evidences of Christianity&mdash;yes, he
had studied them carefully; of course he had.
He had written sermons to prove the truth
of the Holy Scriptures; he had a row of
books on the upper shelf of his library, all
of them treating more or less of this subject.
He turned and looked at them; ponderous
volumes; it was not possible to take
down even the smallest of them and set
Bud to reading it. In the first place, Bud
would no more understand the language in
which it was written than he would understand
the Greek Testament which stood by
its side; and, in the second place, Bud
wanted knowledge that could be transmitted
while the pony was being shod!</p>

<p>Certainly, this dilemma had its ludicrous
side, but had it not also its humiliating
one? Ought there not to be some word
which an educated man like himself could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
give in haste to an ignorant boy like Bud?
Something so plain that even the pony need
not wait while it was being explained? Suppose
the man at the blacksmith-shop had
chosen to sneer over the fact that the earth
is round, and Bud had come for an argument
to prove the truth of this fact, how
easy it would be to produce one!</p>

<p>Ought he not to be equally ready to defend
this much-slandered Bible? Thoughts
are very rapid in their transit. Something
like these ideas rushed through the scholar's
mind while he stood looking up at his row
of books, and Bud stood looking up at him
with an air of confident expectation.</p>

<p>"Bud," said the minister, turning suddenly
away from his book-shelves, "how
many persons are there at Snyder's?"</p>

<p>"Eight or nine, sir; maybe more."</p>

<p>"Are they from around here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; mostly from the country; I don't
know any of 'em."</p>

<p>"Well, Bud, I want you to listen carefully
while I ask two or three questions.
Suppose you had been there before any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
those men, and as one after another began
to come in, each should tell of a fire there
had been last night in the city. Suppose
you knew that they were not acquainted
with each other, and had not met until they
reached the blacksmith's shop, and suppose
they told the same story, without contradicting
one another in any of the important particulars,
what do you believe you would conclude
about them? Would you think that
they had told the truth or a made-up
story?"</p>

<p>"I reckon it would be the truth, sir;
cause how would they know how to make
it up alike?"</p>

<p>"That is just the point," said the gratified
minister. While he talked he had been
watching Bud carefully, much in doubt as
to whether he had mind enough to grasp
the illustration, but so far it had evidently
been grasped; now he must see if it could
be applied.</p>

<p>"Listen! Did you know that thirty-six
people told the story of the Bible, and that
many of them not only never saw one another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
but many of them died before others
of them were born; and that they told the
same story, without contradicting one another
at all?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Bud, "I didn't know nothing
about it. Is that so?" Extreme delight
glowed in his honest eyes, and he
clutched at his cap and made a movement
toward the door. "I thank you, sir; I'll go
back and tell him; it will be a stunner!"</p>

<p>Away went the newly awakened preacher
of the Evidences of Christianity, and the
minister went back to his Greek Testament
with great satisfaction. Bud might not be
able to convince the scoffer at the blacksmith's
shop; Mr. Ramsey did not expect
that he would; he knew that Satan had
many skillful ways of using false weapons
and making them flash like true steel. The
thing which gave him pleasure was, that Bud
had understood. He felt nearly certain that
the boy's mind would not leave the question
there; it would have to be investigated, and
he, the minister, would have to get ready to
help him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"We ought to be careful to speak about
all these things in such a way that uneducated
people could follow us," he said.</p>

<p>And all that morning, while he worked
over his sermon for the following Sabbath,
he worked to secure simple words in which
to clothe his thought; he sought illustrations
to give it clearness; in short, he
preached to Bud; almost unconsciously he
brought the boy before his mind's eye, cap
in hand&mdash;a symbol of the people whose
thoughts rested for a moment on what you
were saying, and then flitted away to something
else&mdash;unless, indeed, the owners were
caught during that moment. This particular
minister had never before so fully realized
this truth. He had never before labored so
hard to catch the attention of the unskilled
listener; nor had he ever become so intensely
interested in any sermon as he did
in that one. If he was to preach it for Bud,
it must be very simple; and in making it
very simple, his own heart took hold of it
as a tremendous reality, instead of a thought
out of a book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope I shall be understood when I say
that Bud wrote the greater part of the
minister's sermon that week; though he
of course, was utterly unconscious of the
fact.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>ONE OF THE VICTIMS.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>MEANTIME there were other interests
at stake that winter than those involved
in the renovation of the old church.
For instance, there was Harry Matthews,
who kept Claire's heart constantly filled with
anxious thought.</div>

<p>It became more and more apparent that
he was in great and growing danger. Claire
saw much of him. He had been one of the
most faithful helpers during the preparations
for the concert, and he was still one of the
energetic workers, being included in all their
plans. Moreover, he was a genial, society-loving,
warm-hearted young fellow; one of
the sort with whom a sympathetic girl soon
becomes intimate. Claire had often, in the
earlier days of her girlhood, sighed over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
fact that she had no brother; and now it
seemed sometimes to her as if this Harry
were a sort of brother, over whose interests
she must watch. So she exercised an older
sister's privilege in growing very anxious
about him.</p>

<p>Neither was he so gayly happy as he had
been early in the season. He had kept his
pledge, coming to her at first with laughing
eyes and mock gravity of face, pretending to
making confession like the good little boy
in the story book, who is sorry, and won't
do so any more if he can help it. She always
received these admissions with a gentle
gravity, so unmistakably tinged with sadness
and disappointment, that they presently
ceased to be amusing to him. He was beginning
to make discoveries: first, that it was
by no means an agreeable thing for a manly
young man to seek a young woman whom
he respected, and voluntarily admit that he
had again been guilty of what he knew she
looked upon with distrust, not only, but
with actual dismay; and second that he had
the confession to make much more frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
than he had supposed could possibly be the
case; that, in short, the habit which he had
supposed such a light one, was growing upon
him; that on occasions when he withstood
the invitations and temptations, the struggle
was a hard one, which he shrank from renewing.
Still he made resolves. It was absurd
to suppose that he could keep running
after Miss Benedict, or sending her notes to
say that he had again indulged in a habit
that he had assured her was of no consequence,
and that he could break in a day if
he chose. He knew now that this was folly.
It was not to be broken in a day. He began
to suspect that possibly he was a slave,
with little or no power to break it at all.
The tenor of his notes changed steadily.
The first one ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have to inform your most gracious
majesty that I have this day committed the
indiscretion of taking about two thirds of a
glass of champagne with an old school chum
whom I have not seen for six months. It
is another chapter of the old story&mdash;he
'beguiled me and I did' drink. Of course
it was no fault of mine; and it gives me
comfort to inform you that the tempter has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
gone on his way to Chicago, and that I do
not expect to see him for another six
months. So humbly craving your majesty's
pardon for being thus obliged to trouble her&mdash;owing
to a certain foolish pledge of mine&mdash;I
remain your humble subject.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Harry Matthews.</span>"<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The last one she received was briefly this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Miss Benedict:</i>&mdash;I have failed again,
though I did not mean to do so. I beg you
will erase my name from that page, and care
nothing more about it or me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Over the first note Claire had lingered
with a troubled air, but on this last one there
dropped tears. She had adopted Harry by
this time as a young brother, and she could
not help carrying his peril about in her
heart. Still, if he had not gone too far, there
was more hope for the writer of this brief
note, with its undertone of fierce self-disgust,
than for the one who could so merrily confess
what he believed was, at the worst, a
foible.</p>

<p>One evening they walked home together
from the church. She was silent, and her
heart was heavy. She had caught the odor
of wine about him, though he had made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
weak effort to conceal it with rich spices.
They walked half the distance from the
church to the Academy, having spoken nothing
beyond an occasional commonplace. Truth
to tell, Claire was in doubt what to say, or
whether to say anything. She had spoken
many words to him; she had written him
earnest little notes; what use to say more?
It was he who broke the silence, speaking
moodily:</p>

<p>"It is of no use, Miss Benedict; I shall
have to ask you to release me from that
pledge. I cannot keep rushing around to
the Academy to tell you what befalls me;
it is absurd. And&mdash;well, the fact is, as I
am situated, I simply can not keep from
using liquor now and then; oftener, indeed,
than I had supposed when I signed that
paper. It must have been a great bore to
you, and I owe you a thousand apologies;
but you see how it is, I must be released
and left to myself. I have been true to my
promise, as I knew I should be when I made
it, but I can't have you troubled any longer;
and, as I say, I <i>have</i> to drink occasionally."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not receive the sort of answer
which he had expected. He was prepared
for an earnest protest, for an argument;
but Claire said, her voice very sad the
while:</p>

<p>"I know you can not keep from drinking,
Harry, and I have known it for a long
while."</p>

<p>Now, although he had told himself several
times in a disgusted way that he was
a coward, and a fool, and a slave, and that
he did not deserve to have the respect of a
lady, his pride was by no means so far gone
that he liked to hear the admission from
other lips than his own that he was bound
in chains which he could not break.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, haughtily
enough.</p>

<p>"I mean, Harry, that you are tempted,
awfully tempted, to become a drunkard! I
mean that I do not think you can help
yourself; I think you have gone beyond the
line where your strength would be sufficient.
You inherit the taste for liquor. Never
mind how I learned that; I know it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
have known it for a long time. As surely
as Satan lives, he has you in his toils. Oh,
Harry!"</p>

<p>There were tears in her voice. She was
not one who easily lost self-control before
others, but this was a subject on which her
heart was sore. He did not know how many
times she had said to herself: "What if
he were my brother, and mamma sat at
home watching and praying for him, and he
were as he is! And his mother is a widow,
and has only this one, and she sits at
home and waits!" And this mother's fast-coming
agony of discovery had burned into
her soul until it is no wonder that the
tears choked what else she might have
said.</p>

<p>But Harry was haughty still. He was
more than that, however; he was frightened.
If the darkness of the night had not
shielded his face from observation, its pallor
would have frightened her. He tried, however,
to steady his voice as he said:</p>

<p>"Miss Benedict, what do you mean? I
do not understand. Do you mean that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
am foreordained to become a drunkard, and
that I can not help myself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry! I mean that the great enemy
of your soul has discovered just how he can
ruin you, body and soul, and he means to
do it. You have toyed with him until you
can not help yourself. You <i>can not</i>, Harry.
There is no use to fancy that you can. He
has ruined many a young man as self-reliant
as you. He is too strong for you, and too
mean! He has ways of dissembling that
you would scorn. He is not honest with
you. He has made you believe what was
utterly false. He has you in his toils, and
as surely as you are here to-night, just so
surely will you fail in the battle with him.
You do not know how to cope with Satan;
you need not flatter yourself that you do.
He has played with many a soul, coaxed it
to feel just that sense of superiority over
him which you feel, until it was too late,
and then laughed at his victim for being a
dupe."</p>

<p>During the first part of this sentence,
Harry Matthews, though startled, was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
angry. He had always prided himself on
his self-control, upon being able to go just
so far in a given direction and no farther
unless he chose; and even in this matter,
when he had accused himself of being a
slave, he had not believed it; he had believed
simply that he had discovered himself
to be more fond of intoxicants than he
had supposed, and that the effect to give
them up involved more self-sacrifice than it
was worth while to make; and while he
was vexed that even this was so, he had
honestly believed this to be the whole story.
It was not until this moment that the sense
of being in actual peril, and being insufficient
for his own rescue, rushed over him.
I do not know why it did at that time,
unless the Holy Spirit saw his opportunity
and willed that it should be so.</p>

<p>There was almost mortal anguish in the
low voice that sounded at last in answer to
Claire's cry of fear.</p>

<p>"God help me, then! What can I do?"</p>

<p>The question surprised Claire, startled her.
She had prayed for it, but she was like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
many another Christian worker in that she
had not seemed to expect the answer to her
prayer. Verily, He has to be content with
exceeding little faith! Claire had expected
the blind young man would go on excusing
himself, and assuring her of her mistake.
None the less was she eager with her
answer:</p>

<p>"If you only <i>meant</i> that cry! If you only
would give up the unequal strife, and stand
aside and cry out, 'O Lord, undertake for
me'! what a world would be revealed to
you. Harry Matthews, there is just One
who fought a battle with Satan and came
off victor, and there never will be another.
The victory must come through Him, or it
is at best a very partial, and at all times
a doubtful one. In Him are safety and
everlasting strength, and outside of Him is
danger."</p>

<p>She did not say another word, nor did
he, other than a half-audible "Good-night!"
as he held open the Academy gate for her
to pass. She went in feeling frightened
over much that she had said. Ought she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
to have spoken so hopelessly to him? What
if he turned in despair, and plunged into
excesses such as he had not known before?
Men had reformed, and signed the pledge
and kept it, apparently without the aid of
Christ; at least, they had not owned allegiance
to him, though well she knew that
his restraining grace was, after all, what
kept any man from rushing headlong to
ruin. God held back even those who would
not own his detaining arm. But she had
felt so hopeless in regard to Harry, so certain
that nothing short of an acknowledged
leaning on Christ would be sufficient for his
needs. The more she had prayed for him,
the more sure had she been that in Christ
alone lay his refuge. She had not meant
to say this to him. Yet the thoughts seemed
to crowd out of themselves, when he gave
them opportunity. Now she went to her
room shivering and trembling over the possible
results.</p>

<p>She had very little opportunity, however, for
thought; and there was that awaiting her
which was not calculated to quiet her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Alice Ansted who rose up from
before the east window, where a fine view
was to be had of the rising moon, and came
forward to meet her as she entered her own
room.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for having taken
possession. There was company in the parlor,
and Mrs. Foster said she thought I
might come here and wait for you. Is
there another committee meeting this evening?
or can I hope to have you to myself
for five minutes?"</p>

<p>"There is no committee meeting this evening,"
Clarie said, smiling, "we have been
down to measure the platform, and arrange
for the organ, but I believe now that everything
is done. Take this easy-chair. I am
glad you waited for me. There are several
things about which I wish to consult you,"
she added.</p>

<p>"They have to do with that church, I
know. I shall not let you get started on
that topic. I should be perfectly certain not
to get you back to any other to-night;
and I want to do the talking myself. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
can not see why you care so much for that
church."</p>

<p>Claire laughed.</p>

<p>"We care for anything for which we
work, and especially for which we sacrifice
a little, you know. Why, you care for it
yourself. Don't you think you do, a little?"</p>

<p>"I care for you, and for your opinion.
I have been telling mamma only this evening,
that when the old barn gets fixed up,
I believe I will go down there to church.
I am not so fond of riding that I care to
take an eight-mile ride every Sunday; besides,
I think it looks silly. Mamma thinks
we are all becoming idiotic, for all the
daughters and the son sided with me, and
papa said he didn't care a rush light which
we did; that it would be easier for the
horses to come down here."</p>

<p>"Good news," said Claire, brightly. "I
have been hoping for something of the kind.
Then you will begin to attend the prayer-meeting,
of course, and it does need you so
much!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't see why I should. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
never attended prayer-meeting in town, and
I have belonged to that church for years.
The idea of <i>my</i> helping along a prayer-meeting!
You do have some very absurd
ideas, Claire Benedict, though I may as well
admit that the only reason I would have
for coming here to church would be to give
you pleasure. But this is not in the least
what I came to talk to you about, I knew
we should get on that subject, and never
get away from it."</p>

<p>"Let us go right away from it, and tell
me, please, just what you want to talk
about. Only let me say this one little
thing: I want you to come down to prayer-meeting
next Wednesday evening, and discover
in how many ways you can help it.
Now I am ready."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>NEW LINES OF WORK.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>BUT Alice hesitated. The subject, whatever
it was that she wanted to talk
about, evidently had its embarrassing side.
Now that Claire sat in expectant silence,
she grew silent too, and looked down, and
toyed with the fringe of her wrap, her face
in a frown that indicated either perplexity
or distrust.</div>

<p>"I don't know why I should come to
you," she said, at last, speaking half-angrily;
"I suppose I am a simpleton, and shall get
little thanks for any interference, yet it certainly
seems to me as though something ought
to be done, and as though you might do it."</p>

<p>"If there is any way in which I can help
you," Claire said, "you hardly need to have
me say how glad I shall be to do so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you, I wonder? Would you help
in a perplexity that seems to me to be growing
into a downright danger, and which I
more than half suspect you could avert?"</p>

<p>There was something so significant in her
tone, that Claire looked at her in wonderment
for a moment, then said, choosing her
words with care:</p>

<p>"You surely know that I would be only
too glad to help you in any way that was
right, and of course you would not ask me
to do anything that I thought wrong."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not so sure of that. You have
such peculiar ideas of right and wrong.
They are not according to my standard, I
presume. How I wish I knew, without telling
you, just what you would think right;
it would settle several questions for me, or
else it would unsettle me, for I might not
want to do what was right, you see, any
more than you would want to do what was
wrong."</p>

<p>"I am not a witch," said Claire, lightly,
"and I confess that I have no more idea
what you mean than if you were speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
in Sanscrit. Suppose you speak English for
a few minutes, my friend, and enlighten
me."</p>

<p>"I will, presently. I want to ask you a
few general questions first, which have nothing
special to do with the question at hand.
Would you marry a man who was not a
Christian?"</p>

<p>"No," said Claire, wondering, startled yet
nevertheless prompt enough with her answer;
"that is, I do not now see how I could.
In the first place, I would not be likely to
have the opportunity; for I could not be
sufficiently interested in a man who had no
sympathy with me in these vital questions,
to ever reach the point as to my possible
opportunities and duties."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that doesn't materially enlighten
me. You see I am talking about people who
<i>could</i> become sufficiently interested to reach
a great many questionings, and not know
what to do with them. Let me suppose a
case. We will say the people live in China,
and become deeply interested in each other.
In the course of time one of them goes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the Fiji Islands for instance, and meets a missionary,
and comes somewhat under her influence&mdash;enough,
we will say, to make her
uncomfortable and to make her suspect that
she is a good deal of a heathen herself,
though she was a member in good and
regular standing of a church in China. To
make the circumstances more interesting
you may suppose that one of the converted
heathen begins to interest himself in her,
and to enlighten her as to the power of
genuine religion over the heathen heart and
mind to such an extent that she is almost
sure she knows nothing about it experimentally;
and at the same time has a yearning
desire to know and to receive the mysterious
<i>something</i> which she discovers in this
one. We will also suppose that she receives
letters from China occasionally, which show
her that the other party has met neither
missionary nor heathen to impress him in
any way, and that his plans and determinations
are all of the earth and decidedly
earthy, and yet that he is disposed to think
that the lady ought to be thinking about returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
to China, and joining him in his effort
to have a good time. What, in your
estimation, ought the half-awakened Fiji resident
to do?"</p>

<p>"Alice, is some not very distant city representing
China? and is South Plains Fiji?
and is Bud the converted heathen?"</p>

<p>"There is enough witch about you to
have secured you a very warm experience
in the olden days. Never mind translating,
if you please; this was not to be in English.
What ought the Fiji to do?"</p>

<p>"I should think there could be no question.
A half-awakened person would still be
in danger of dropping back into darkness,
and should, as surely as she believes in the
petition, 'lead me not into temptation,' guard
against anything that would be a contradiction
to that prayer."</p>

<p>"Well, but suppose this half-awakened person
were married to the party in China&mdash;what
then?"</p>

<p>"That would be a very different matter.
The irrevocable vows would have been taken
before the world; the 'until death do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
part' would have been accepted, and there
would be no liberty of choice."</p>

<p>"I don't see the reasoning clearly. Suppose
a person should take a vow to commit
murder, and announce her determination before
the world to do so, with as solemn a
vow as you please, ought her conscience to
hold her? Not," she added, with a slight
and embarrassed laugh, "that I would put
the idea of murder as a parallel case with
the other imagining. I don't mean anything,
you know, by all this, I am simply dealing
with some imaginary people in China."</p>

<p>But Claire did not smile, and held herself
carefully to the analogy of the illustration:</p>

<p>"You are supposing a moral impossibility,
Alice. No one would be allowed to take a
public and solemn oath to commit murder.
The very oath would be a violation of the
laws of God and of the land; but in the
other case, the oath taken professes to be
in keeping with God's revealed will and with
the demands of respectable society. Surely,
you see what an infinite difference this would
make."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, yes, of course. Well, I'll suppose
one thing more. For purposes of convenience,
let us have these two people engaged
to each other, but the pledge not consummated
before the public&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>But over this question Claire kept a
troubled silence.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she said, at last; "I
am not sure how that ought to be answered.
Perhaps it is one of the things which each
individual is called upon to answer for himself,
or herself, taking it to God for special
light. A betrothal seems to me a very
solemn thing, not to be either entered into, or
broken, lightly, and yet I can conceive of
circumstances wherein it would be right to
break the pledge&mdash;where it was wrong ever
to have made it&mdash;and two wrongs cannot
make a right, you know. But Alice, this is
dangerous ground. I am almost inclined to
think it is ground where a third party, on
the human side, should not intermeddle; at
least, unless it is one who has far more
wisdom than I. It is not possible for me
to advise you in this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>"You <i>have</i> advised me," Alice said, with
exceeding gravity. "All I wanted was your
individual opinion, and that you have given
plainly, though you may not be aware of
it. When one knows one is doing a thing
that is wrong, I suppose the time has come
to draw back."</p>

<p>"If the drawing back can right the wrong."</p>

<p>"It can help toward it. These people&mdash;who
live in China, remember&mdash;are perhaps
among those who ought never to have made
the pledge. However, let us drop them. I
want to talk to you about a more important
matter."</p>

<p>Still she did not talk, but relapsed again
into troubled silence, and Claire, not knowing
what to say, waited, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Would you marry a man, if you thought
you might possibly be the means of saving
his soul?"</p>

<p>Claire was startled and a trifle disturbed
to think that the conversation was still to
run in a channel with which she was so
unfamiliar. Still, this first question was comparatively
easy to deal with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>"That might depend on whether I could do
so without assuming false vows. I could not
promise a lie for the sake of saving any
soul. Besides, it being wrong in itself, I
would have no reason to hope that it would
be productive of any good, for God does
not save souls by means which are sinful.
Why do you ask me all these questions,
Alice? I have no experience, and am not
wise. I wish you would seek a better counselor."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I have all the counsel I
desire. I am not talking about those people
in China any more, though you think
I am. I was thinking of you, and of somebody
who is in danger, and whom I believe
you could save, but I know you won't&mdash;at
least not in that way. Claire Benedict, I
am troubled about my brother. Tell me
this, do you know that he is in danger?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Claire, her voice low and
troubled.</p>

<p>"Do you know from what source I mean?"</p>

<p>"I think I do."</p>

<p>"I thought you did else I am not sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
that my pride would have allowed me to
open my lips. Well, do you know there is
something you might do to help him?"</p>

<p>"Alice."</p>

<p>"No, you are not to interrupt me. I don't
mean anything insulting. There are ways of
which I would be more sure, and they are
connected with you, but I know they are
out of the question. I am not going to talk
of them. But there is something I want you
to do. I want you to talk with mamma.
It is of no use for me to say a word to
her. There are family reasons why she is
specially vexed with me just now, and will
not listen reasonably to anything that I
might say. But she respects you, and likes
you, and you have more or less influence
over her. Are you willing to use it for
Louis' sake?"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Alice, I do not understand
you in the least. What could I say to your
mother that she does not already know?
and in any case, how could she materially
help your brother? He needs the help of
his own will."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true, but there are ways in
which mamma might help him, if she would.
I can tell you of some. In the first place,
you are mistaken as to her knowledge. She
knows, it is true, that he takes more wine
occasionally than is good for him, and has
violent headaches in consequence; but she
does not know that two nights in a week,
at least, he comes home intoxicated! Isn't
that a terrible thing to say of one's brother?
What has become of the Ansted pride, when
I can say it to almost a stranger?"</p>

<p>"Why does not your mother know?"</p>

<p>"Partly because she is blind, and partly
because I have promised Louis not to tell
her, and partly because there are reasons
why it would be especially hard on my
mother to have this knowledge brought to
her through me. You see there are reasons
enough. Now for what she could do. Claire,
she fairly drives him into temptation. There
is a certain house in the city which she is
very anxious to see united to ours. She contrives
daily pretexts for sending Louis there,
and it is almost impossible for him to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
there without coming home the worse for
liquor. I <i>wish</i> I could talk more plainly to
you. I will tell you this. There is a brother
as well as a sister in that house, and it has
been a pet dream of my mother to exchange
the sons and daughters. It is a romantic,
Old World scheme, grown up with the families
from their early days; and mamma, who
has never been accustomed to having her
plans thwarted, is in danger of seeing all of
these come to naught, and more than half
believes that I am plotting against it for
Louis, having first shown myself to be an
undutiful and ungrateful daughter. Do you
see how entirely my tongue is silenced? I
wonder if you do understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand, my dear friend, and I
thank you for your confidence; but I do
not see how a stranger can help, or indeed,
can interfere in any way, without being
guilty of gross rudeness. How could I hope
to approach your mother on such subjects as
these, without having her feel herself insulted?"</p>

<p>Alice made a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>"You <i>can not</i>," she said, "if you think
more of the irritable words that a troubled
mother may say to you than you do of a
soul in peril; but I did not think you were
of that sort."</p>

<p>Claire waited a moment before replying.</p>

<p>"I think I may be trusted to try to do what
seems right, even though it were personally
hard," she said at last, speaking very
gently; "but, Alice, I do not understand
how words of mine could do other than
mischief."</p>

<p>"I can show you. This family, I have
told you, is a continual snare to Louis. He
simply can not go there without being led
into great temptation, and mamma is responsible
for the most of his visits. It would
not be difficult for Louis to remain away,
if mamma did not make errands for him.
He would go abroad with the Husons next
week, and be safe from this and many other
temptations, or he would go to the Rocky
Mountains with Harold Chessney&mdash;and he
could not be in better society&mdash;if mamma
would give her consent, and she would, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
she could be made to realize his peril&mdash;if
she knew that outsiders were talking about
it. Don't you see?</p>

<p>"Now, who is going to enlighten her? I
am not in favor&mdash;less so just at present
than ever before; the girls, poor young
things, do not know of our disgrace, and
would have no influence with mamma if they
did, and papa would like the alliance from
a business point of view as well as mamma
would from a romantic and fashionable one.
Do you see the accumulation of troubles?
and do you imagine, I wonder, what it is to
<i>me</i>, when I have humbled myself to tell it
all to you?"</p>

<p>"And this young lady?" said Claire, ignoring
the personal questions. "Do you feel
sure that there is no hope of help from that
source? Is not her interest deep enough
and her influence strong enough to come to
the rescue if she fully understood?"</p>

<p>There was again that gesture of extreme
impatience.</p>

<p>"That young lady! She has no more character
than a painted doll! Claire Benedict, she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
in as great danger to-day as Louis is, and from
the same source! She dances every night, and
buoys up her flagging strength by stimulants
every day. I have seen her repeatedly when
she was so excited with wine that I knew
she did not know what she was saying."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" This was Claire's startled
exclamation.</p>

<p>"It is not only possible, but is an almost
daily occurrence. And she fills the glass with
her own silly little hand, which trembles at
the moment with the excitement of wine,
and holds it to my brother, and he, poor,
foolish boy! accepts it because he knows that
he likes it better than anything else in the
world&mdash;at least, that is attainable. Claire,
if my mother could be prevailed upon to
urge Louis to go away with Harold Chessney,
I believe he might be saved."</p>

<p>"Who is Harold Chessney?"</p>

<p>"He is one of God's saints, made for the
purpose of showing us what a man might
be, if he would. Claire Benedict, will you
try?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>UNPALATABLE TRUTHS.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>"YES," said Claire, "I will try."</div>

<p>But she said it with a long-drawn
sigh. This was work that was utterly distasteful
to her, and she saw but little hope
of accomplishing anything by attempting it.</p>

<p>She wanted to fight the demon of alcohol
wherever found&mdash;at least, she had thought
that she did; but who would have supposed
that it could bring her into such strange
contact with Mrs. Russel Ansted?</p>

<p>In order that you may understand why
this plan of rescue had suggested itself to
Alice Ansted's mind, it will be necessary
to explain that the acquaintance which had
been commenced by accident had been allowed
to mature into what might almost be
called friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>At least, it had pleased Mrs. Ansted to
encourage the intimacy between her young
people and the attractive music-teacher.</p>

<p>"It is not as though she had been simply
a music-teacher, and nothing else, all her
life," was Mrs. Ansted wont to explain to
her city friends. "She is a daughter of the
Boston Benedicts, and, of course, her opportunities
have been rare. She is simply
faultless in her manners; the girls learn a
great deal from her, and are devoted to her,
and she really is a charming companion.
You know in the country we have no society."</p>

<p>So Claire had been made almost oppressively
welcome to the lovely house on the
hill, and the sleigh or the carriage had
been sent for her many times when she
could not go, and in many kind and pleasant
ways had the entire family sought to
show their interest in her society. Mrs.
Ansted, indeed, patronized her to such an
extent that Alice had made herself imagine
that in this direction might be found the
light which would open the mother's eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
to certain things which she ought to see and
did not.</p>

<p>Claire did not share her hopes. She had
always felt herself held back from real heart
intimacy with the fair and worldly woman;
had always detected the tinge of patronage in
the kindness shown her, and had even smiled
sometimes at the thought of how the very attentions
which she received placidly, and, in
a sense gratefully, would chafe her hot-headed
young sister Dora. It had given her joy of
heart and cause for gratitude to realize that
she herself had been lifted above such chafings.
There were trials in her lot, but Mrs. Ansted's
patronage was not one of them. Still
it made her feel that little would be gained
by attempted interference in her family affairs.
Under the circumstances, she felt herself
intrusive, yet determined to submit and
thereby convince Alice of her willingness and
powerlessness. The most she had to fear
was a little drawing up of the aristocratic
shoulders, and a cold and courteous hint
that some things belonged exclusively to the
domain of very close friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on the following Saturday that opportunity
offered for an attempt. Claire was
spending the day with the Ansteds; the invitation
had come from the mother, and was
unusually cordial. Louis was in town, would
probably remain over the Sabbath, and the
girls were lonely. The mother did not know
how much more readily the invitation was
accepted because Louis was in town.</p>

<p>They were in Mrs. Ansted's own sitting-room.
The young girls had been called to
the sewing-room at the mandate of the dressmaker,
and Alice, telegraphing Claire that
now was her opportunity, slipped away.
Have you ever observed how much harder
it becomes to set about a delicate and embarrassing
duty when circumstances have been
carefully made for you, and you are left to
stare in the face the thought "I am to do
this thing, <i>now</i>; it is expected of me?"</p>

<p>Immediately Claire began to feel that it
would be preposterous in her to try to advise
or enlighten Mrs. Ansted. But that
lady unconsciously helped her by asking:</p>

<p>"Did you ever meet Mr. Harold Chessney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
in Boston? I believe he calls that his home,
though he is abroad a great deal. I wish
he were abroad now, instead of planning an
excursion to the Rocky Mountains and all
sorts of out-of-the-world places, and putting
Louis into a fever to accompany him. I
have a horror of those Western expeditions
entered into by young men. Louis will not
go contrary to my approval, however, so I
need not worry about it. It is a great
comfort to a mother to have a dutiful son,
my dear."</p>

<p>"It must be," Claire hastened to say, but
added that she should think it would be a
delightful trip for a young man, and a rare
opportunity to see his own country. She
was not personally acquainted with Mr.
Chessney, but she had heard him very highly
spoken of.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is perfection, I suppose," Mrs.
Ansted said carelessly; "too perfect, my
dear, for ordinary flesh and blood. He is
very wealthy and very eccentric; has innumerable
ways for wasting his money on savages,
and all that sort of thing. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
really almost fear his influence over Louis,
he is such an impressible boy. Harold might
fancy it his duty to become a home missionary."
This last was spoken with a little
satisfied laugh, as though Louis Ansted's
position was too well assured, after all, to
suggest any reasonable fears of his sinking
to the level of a home missionary! The
matron speedily composed her face, however,
and added:</p>

<p>"Harold is a magnificent man, I have no
doubt, and if Louis were a young man of
depraved tendencies and low tastes, probably
I should hope for nothing better than to exile
him for awhile with such a guard; but
in his position, and with his prospects, the
idea is, of course, absurd. I don't know
what fancies Alice has in mind, the child
seems quite to favor Louis' going. Alice is
a little inclined to be fanatical, I am afraid,
in some things. I hope you will not encourage
such tendencies, my dear. I have
seen with pleasure that she is becoming more
interested in religion, and disposed to help
poor Bud, though she has chosen some foolish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
ways of doing that&mdash;but still it is quite
as it should be to rouse to the importance
of these things; I have been pained with
her indifference in the past. However, we
should not carry anything to extremes, you
know."</p>

<p>They were not getting on. Claire did
not feel like a diplomatist. She was disposed
to be straightforward. Would not simple
truth serve her purpose in this case?
At least, it would be less humiliating than
to try to worm herself into family confidences.
So she spoke her plain question:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ansted, has it never seemed to you
that it would be well for Louis to get
away for a time from some of his associates
who tempt him in the direction in which he
is least able to bear temptation?"</p>

<p>Plain English was not palatable, or else
it was not understood. Two red spots glowed
on the mother's cheek, but her eyes were
cold.</p>

<p>"And what is that, if you please? I was
not aware that my son was particularly susceptible
to any temptation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Could this be true? Did she not know
that he was tempted to reel home at midnight
like a common drunkard? If so, what
an awful revelation for a stranger to make!</p>

<p>Claire hesitated, and the lady looked steadily
at her and waited. Simple truth should
serve her again; it would be insulting to offer
anything else.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ansted, you will pardon me for referring
to it, but I know from your son's
own statements that he is tempted in the
direction of liquor, and that he finds it
hard to resist these temptations, and I am
afraid he is in great danger. If I were his
mother, and had confidence in this Mr.
Chessney, I should beg him to go out with
him, and break away from his present surroundings."</p>

<p>She was deceived in the mother&mdash;in the
calm with which she listened to these words.
She did not cry out like one amazed and
hurt, nor did she look like one who was
being shocked into a faint; and Claire, watching
her, hurried on, determined to make her
disagreeable revelations as brief as she could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and then to get away from the subject.
Surely the mother could not feel much humiliated
before her, when she confessed that
she had received these intimations from the son.</p>

<p>But directly her voice ceased, the mother
arose, her own tones low and ladylike as
usual:</p>

<p>"I am not aware, Miss Benedict, that our
kind treatment of you can have furnished
any excuse for this direct and open insult.
I did not know that you had succeeded in
securing my son's confidence to such a degree
that he had been led to traduce his
friends. I can not imagine his motive; but
allow me to say that yours is plain, and
will fail. The lady to whom Mr. Louis
Ansted has been paying special attention
for years, can not be thrown off, even by
his taking a trip to the Rocky Mountains;
and if you hope to ingratiate yourself in
the mother's heart by trying to arouse her
fears, you have made a grievous mistake.
My daughters are evidently more susceptible,
and I now understand some things that
were before mysterious to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sorry for you, Miss Benedict. I
can well imagine that it is a hard thing to
be poor; but it is a pity to add disgrace
to poverty. You have been unwise to try
to work up fanatical ideas on my son. We
are none of us temperance fanatics."</p>

<p>There was a dangerous fire in Claire's
eyes, but she struggled to keep back the
words that hurried forward, clamoring to be
spoken. This woman before her was old
enough to be her mother, and was the
mother of a young man whom she would
try to save.</p>

<p>Besides, she had the force of habit to
help her. The controlled voice which belongs
to the cultured lady, even under
strong provocation, was as much a part of
her as it was of Mrs. Ansted.</p>

<p>"I will pass by your personalities, Mrs.
Ansted, as unworthy of you, and ask you
to pardon my apparent intrusion into family
affairs, on the sole ground that I have
come into possession of some knowledge
concerning your son's danger which I have
reason to believe you do not possess, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
thought I ought, as a Christian woman, to
warn you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansted was already repenting of
some of her words&mdash;beginning, that is, to
realize that she had been unnecessarily insulting
to a guest in her own home, and
one whom her son, as well as her daughters,
liked and admired. She was not less
angry, but more controlled.</p>

<p>"Possibly you mean well," she said, dropping
into the patronizing tone which was
habitual, "and I may have spoken too
plainly, in my haste; a mother's feelings,
when she considers the characters of her
children insulted, are sometimes not sufficiently
held in check. We will conclude,
Miss Benedict, that your motive was good,
though your words were unfortunate, and
your conclusions unwarrantable. My son is
entirely capable of taking care of himself.
If you are really sincere in supposing him
to be in danger, because he takes an occasional
glass of wine, it only proves you
to be lamentably ignorant of the customs
of polite society. And now I must beg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
you to excuse me. Excitement always
wearies me, and I feel that I must lie
down for awhile. I presume my daughter
will be in soon."</p>

<p>And Claire was left alone to gather her
startled thoughts and determine what to do
next. She was greatly excited. In all her
imaginings of a mother's heart, nothing of
this kind had occurred.</p>

<p>It had been a serious failure, as she had
feared it would be, but not of the kind
which she had planned.</p>

<p>She looked about her for paper on which
to write a line to Alice; then determined
that she would do no such thing, lest Alice
might have to bear blame in consequence.</p>

<p>She would just slip quietly away, and go
home and think. It was not clear in her
mind what ought to be said to Alice. She
had been insulted, and by Alice's mother,
and she could not longer remain a guest in
the house; but perhaps it was not necessary
that Alice should know all this. She
must wait, and think, and pray.</p>

<p>At least, it would not be wise to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
any expression about Mrs. Ansted until she
could think less bitterly of the words spoken
to her; for it is by no means a pleasant
thing to be misjudged, and it is especially
difficult to keep one's mouth closed when
one has that to tell which would silence all
the hints forever. It had required all the
self-control which Claire possessed not to
tell Mrs. Ansted to ask her son whether
the insinuations which had been flung at
her meant anything. Certainly she was not
in the mood to have an interview with
Alice.</p>

<p>She hastily and quietly possessed herself
of her wraps, and stole out of the house
and down the avenue which had in the
few weeks past become so familiar to her.
Bud saw her from the distant stables, but
he only made her a most respectful bow.
It was no strange sight to him. He knew
that she came and went often during these
days; he did not know she was thinking
that in all probability she would never walk
down that avenue again.</p>

<p>There is no use explaining to you that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
she cried when she reached home; cried
bitterly, and with a perfect abandon, as
though her heart were broken. She was
young and had not had many hard words
to bear, and all her sharp thrusts from life
had come upon her lately; her knowledge
of human nature had been increasing with
painful rapidity, and there were times when
she shrank from it all, and wanted to go
to her father.</p>

<p>But after the crying&mdash;or, indeed, in the
very midst of it&mdash;she prayed: for herself
first&mdash;she felt so sore, and ill-used, and
friendless; then for Louis Ansted&mdash;the special
danger and the special friendlessness of
a man with such a mother, took hold of
her with power, and at last she prayed for
the mother; not <i>at</i> her, but for her.</p>

<p>There is a way of praying about a soul
with whom we are offended&mdash;or, at least,
we call it praying&mdash;which is simply pouring
out one's knowledge of that person's
shortcomings in an almost vindictive way
before the One whom we almost unconsciously
feel ought to come to our help and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
administer rebuke. Claire honestly prayed
for Louis Ansted's mother. Her eyes must
be opened, but how? Must it be that they
were to be opened by the utter ruin of
her only son?</p>

<p>That this might not be necessary, Claire
prayed, and rose up presently, almost forgetful
that she had received deep wounds,
and quite ready to shield that mother's
shortcomings from her children.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>RECOGNITION.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AND now I desire you to imagine the
worshipers gathered one morning in the
little church at South Plains. The winter
over and gone; the time of the singing of
birds and of sweet-scented flowers had come.
The marvel of the annual resurrection from
the grave of winter was being lived over
again in nature. But within the sanctuary
it seemed more than resurrection, almost
creation. Was it the same church at all?
What had become of the dusty floors, and
the smoky walls, and the rusty stove-pipe,
and the smoking stoves, and the square table,
and the swaying, faded, red curtains, and the
faded and worn ingrain rag which had covered
the platform, and the dust, and the rust
and the dreariness? What a strange effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
that paper of a quiet tint, and yet with a
suggestion of sunlight in it, had on those
hitherto bare and smoky walls! How high
the frescoing made the ceiling look! What
an excellent imitation of "real" were the
carefully-grained seats! How perfectly the
carpet harmonized in pattern and coloring
with the paper on the walls! Small wonder,
this last, if you had known how many patient
hours mamma and Dora had spent in
reaching the important decision, "Which
shall we send?"</div>

<p>As for the pulpit, it was "real," without
any paint about it, and so neat, and pretty,
and graceful, that the girls had exhausted
all adjectives on it. And really, the stove-pipe,
though it wandered about according to
some wild freak that was considered necessary
in order to "draw," did not look so
objectionable now that it was real Russia;
and nothing could glow more brilliantly than
the stoves, which smoked no more. Engineer
Bud had been a success.</p>

<p>Still, I know that I can not make you
realize the difference in that church. Unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
you were there on that dreary winter morning
when Claire Benedict first looked upon
it with utter sinking of heart, and then
were there again on that spring morning,
and caught the breath of the flowers, and
saw the shimmer of awakened life over
everything within and without, you will
never understand it. Unless, indeed, you
look up some other man-forsaken sanctuary,
and try the delightful experiment of transformation.</p>

<p>There were those in South Plains who
knew and felt the difference.</p>

<p>They gathered softly, the worshipers, the
men on tiptoe, though they need not have
done that, for the heavy carpet gave back
no sound of footfall, but it was one of
their ways of expressing admiration and reverence.
They gave quick, admiring, amazed
glances about them, then riveted their eyes,
as the workers had meant they should, on
the motto which glowed before them, strung
from lamp to lamp in some spirit-like fashion
which those unacquainted with the management
of silver ware cannot comprehend, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
made the triumphant announcement: "<span class="smcap">The
Lord is in his holy temple</span>." And I tell
you that, so much has the outward and
tangible to do with our spiritual vision,
there were those present who grasped this
stupendous fact for the first time.</p>

<p>The organ squeaked no more. It had only
been a matter of a drop of oil which quieted
that, and yet that congregation had actually
sat under its squeak almost for years! So
many things in this world squeak for the
want of a thoughtful hand to administer a
drop of oil!</p>

<p>Then the choir&mdash;that almost hardest thing
in country or city to manage successfully&mdash;had
been transformed. There had been no
violent wrenches; occasionally it happens that
a combination of circumstances bring about
unlooked-for and delightful results. The discordant
alto had married, bless her, and gone to
another town; the flatting tenor had sprained
his ankle, poor man, and must needs abide
at home. The tremendous bass had that
rare quality, common-sense, and discovered on
the evening of the concert that South Plains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
had taken a musical prize, and was himself
the one to propose that Miss Benedict and
her class should be invited to join the choir;
and further, that Miss Benedict should be requested
to drill the choir, and had put
himself under training, and his voice being
really grand, he bade fair, under culture,
to become the power in song that God designed.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it was accident,
or a blessed design, that the much astonished,
much-encouraged, young-old minister,
in a new coat which was an Easter gift
from the young men of his congregation,
read the hymn&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
I love her gates, I love the road;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The church adorned with grace,</span><br />
Stands like a palace built for God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To show his milder face.</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>But I know that he read it as that people
had never heard him read a hymn before,
with an unction and a quiver of feeling
which said almost as plainly as words:</div>

<p>"The Lord reigneth, and this is his holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
temple, and I am his chosen mouthpiece to
this people: I had almost forgotten it, but
it is so." Then when that reconstructed choir
rolled out the words, led by the centre voice
of exquisite melody and power, the worshipers
felt the sentiment of the hymn fill their
hearts, and admitted that they did love her
gates, and that they must rouse up and
show their love as they had not done heretofore.</p>

<p>Ah! there was more in that church that
day than new carpet, and new furniture, and
paint, and paper, and light and beauty.
These were all well enough, and Claire
Benedict's sense of the fitness of things rejoiced
in them all. But what were they to
the thrill in her heart as she heard the
minister read among the names announced
for reception into the visible communion of
the church, that of Hubbard Myers. There
were some who did not know to whom the
name belonged; and it was not surprising,
for Hubbard Myers had been called only
Bud for so many years, the wonder was
that he remembered his name himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been great astonishment among
some, and not a little shaking of heads,
when Bud presented himself as a candidate
for church-membership. It had not been
supposed that he had intellect enough to
understand the meaning of the step. There
was close questioning on the part of the
minister, not for himself alone, but for the
enlightenment of others; but before the examination
closed, more than one of the listeners
drew out their red handkerchiefs,
and blew their noses suspiciously, and at last,
one of the most stolid of them remarked:</p>

<p>"It is my opinion, brethren, that the boy
has been taught of God, and I think we
would do well to accept him without any
further delay." And they did.</p>

<p>There were other trophies. Where would
be the church of Christ without its living,
working members? One who was pledged to
prefer Jerusalem above her chief joy, had
not been, and in the very nature of the
case, <i>could not</i> have been, content with toiling
simply for the outward adorning of
the temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>A history of the quiet work which had
been done in hearts during that one winter
would fill a volume. I have but given you
a hint of it here and there. The head of
the Church has the complete record. There
is perhaps little need that I should try to
give you even scattered notes of it. Yet
there was one name which made the tears
come very near to falling, as Claire listened
for it, fearful that it might not come, and
at the same moment hopeful for it. It was
only a transferral from a church in the city
to membership with the one at South Plains,
and it was only Alice Ansted. Her parents
were not even present in the church. But
Claire knew that a visible union with the
church of Christ meant to Alice Ansted
to-day what it never had before. And she
knew that the two girls, Fanny and Ella
Ansted, who sat and cried, in the pew beside
Alice, were only left out because parental
authority had asserted itself, and said
they were not to come. Claire knew that
they had united themselves with the great
Head, and were members of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
in the "Jerusalem which is above and is
free." They could afford to bide their time.</p>

<p>And there was another still which gave
Claire's heart a peculiar thrill of joy. Not
that his name was read, or that many, as
yet, knew about Satan's defeat with him.
It had been recent, and the public recognition
of the fact was yet to come. But the
Lord Jesus Christ knew, for he had been
the victor.</p>

<p>It was only the night before, as they
were about to leave the reconstructed church,
and Mary Burton, with a long-drawn breath
of repressed excitement, had declared that
everything was ready for to-morrow, and
that the victory was complete, that Harry
Matthews had bent toward Claire and murmured:</p>

<p>"Miss Benedict, there has been another
victory. You will know that it is far more
wonderful than this. He has 'undertaken'
for me."</p>

<p>There had only been time to grasp his
hand and flash back an answer from sympathetic
eyes, but there was a song in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
heart this morning over the news. Occasionally
she glanced at Harry, and told
herself that she would have known, just to
look at him, that the highest experience
this life has for us had come to him.</p>

<p>The little church was unusually full on
this triumphant morning, and yet most of
the faces were known to Claire. Strangers
were not frequent at South Plains. Yet
there was one, a gentleman, who gave that
reverent heed to the service which even
among strangers distinguishes those who
really join in worship from those who
merely look on. This man joined, and with
his heart. Claire was sure of it. It was
this man that Harry Matthews watched, a
satisfied smile on his face the while. Harry
could imagine just how surprised the stranger
was.</p>

<p>On the evening before, when he had
reached his room, after giving his wonderful
news to Claire, instead of finding it in
darkness, his kerosene lamp had been turned
to its highest capacity, and a gentleman
sat in front of his little stove, feeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
it from time to time, apparently for the
sole purpose of brightening the somewhat
dismal room.</p>

<p>"Halloo!" had been Harry's greeting.</p>

<p>"Just so," was the quiet response. "You
did not know you had company, did you,
my boy?"</p>

<p>And then there had been such eager
grasping of hands, and such lighting up of
faces, as evinced the satisfaction of both
parties at meeting. For this was Harry
Matthews' favorite uncle, and he must
lately have come from the home where
Harry's mother waited for him.</p>

<p>Of course there was a high-tide of question
and answer at once. It was not until
an hour afterward that Harry reached the
subject of which he had instantly thought,
on seeing his uncle.</p>

<p>"Uncle Harold, didn't you know the
Benedicts?"</p>

<p>"What Benedicts?"</p>

<p>"Why, the Boston ones. Sydney L. He
failed, and died, less than a year ago, don't
you remember?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>"I remember. I knew him well. I met
him abroad."</p>

<p>"And didn't you know his daughter?"</p>

<p>"I knew that he had a daughter, and, in
fact, I think I saw her once; but we were
not acquainted."</p>

<p>"Why, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Why?" with a slightly-curious laugh.
"There might be many reasons, I am sure.
Boston spreads over a good deal of ground.
Besides, you know I never spent a great
deal of time in Boston, and I am not a
society man. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"No reason in particular; only the lady
is here, and I thought if you were old acquaintances,
it would be pleasant to meet
her."</p>

<p>"Here in South Plains! What in the
world is she doing here?"</p>

<p>"Teaching music."</p>

<p>"I wonder if this is where she has hidden
herself! I occasionally hear queries as
to what has become of her, but I believe
I never met a person who knew. No, I
don't suppose there would be any mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
pleasure in a meeting. I may be said to
be a stranger. I have not the least idea
how she looks; and I may never have met
her, though I think I did somewhere. I
remember having a passing interest in seeing
how a daughter of Sydney Benedict
would look. He was a grand man, but I
suspected that his daughter was a butterfly
of fashion. She lived in the very centre of
that sort of thing, and her father was supposed
to have immense wealth. I suppose
she is a poor, crushed little morsel, done
up in crape and disappointment. I am always
sorry for music-scholars who have to
take broken-down ladies for teachers. Still,
I don't know but I would like to shake
hands with her for her father's sake. Have
you met her?"</p>

<p>"I should say I had! but I don't believe
you ever have. You couldn't draw such a
queer picture of her as that, if you had
ever seen her. She doesn't wear crape at
all. Somebody told me she did not believe
in mourning for people who had gone to
heaven; at least, not in putting on black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
clothes and looking doleful, you know. And
as to being crushed! why, uncle Harold,
she is the brightest, sweetest, grandest girl
I ever heard of in all my life."</p>

<p>"Possible!" said his uncle, with a good-humored
laugh. "Why, my boy, she must
be several years older than you! What
does this mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" was the impatient reply
of the excited young man. "It is just as
evident as can be, that you don't know
what you are talking about. If you had
been here this winter, and watched things
work, and known the hand that she had
in it all, why&mdash;look here! you wait until
to-morrow; I can show you a few things, I
fancy."</p>

<p>Whereupon he immediately closed his lips;
and although his uncle pretended to be extremely
curious, and to be unable to wait
until morning for light, no hints or questions
could draw out further information in
the same direction.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>DANGERS SEEN AND UNSEEN.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IT was this man, then, to whom Harry
Matthews' eyes often wandered during
that morning service. The look of profound
amazement which had settled on his
uncle's face after the first sweeping glance
which he gave the little church, had caused
Harry the keenest satisfaction. The more
so that during the morning he had been
addressed after this fashion:</div>

<p>"The only regret I had, when I found
that I could drop off at South Plains and
spend a day or two, was that it was Saturday,
and the Sabbath would have to be
spent in that forlorn little box where you
go to church. I have vivid recollections of
the day I spent with you a year ago. Harry,
my boy, I don't like to think of your Sabbaths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
being passed amid such unpleasant
surroundings. I shall be glad when your
engagement here closes. You don't think of
renewing it, I hope? I have plans which I
want to talk over with you to-morrow?"</p>

<p>But Harry had been too full of the surprise
in store, to make any reply to these
questionings, other than to say:</p>

<p>"Come on, uncle Harold; I sing in the
choir, and I promised to be there in good
time."</p>

<p>None the less was he watching for that
first look, and it satisfied him. He wanted
to laugh outright, but of course he did no
such thing; instead, he seated his amazed
relative in one of the best pews, then took
his place in the choir, all of his face save
his eyes in decorous repose.</p>

<p>All the bright Sabbath afternoon they sat
together, uncle and nephew; the one an
eager narrator, the other an attentive listener.
Every step of the colossal plan, as
it appeared to others, and was matured and
carried out by the unfaltering zeal of Claire
Benedict, was detailed for the uncle's benefit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
And certainly Claire's reputation did
not suffer in the young man's hands. He
could not help glorifying her. None knew
better than he, what she had been to him;
but of this more sacred story he as yet
said nothing. Its time was to come.</p>

<p>"Why, uncle Harold, you remember Bud,"
he burst forth afresh after a moment's silence,
"that queer fellow who worked for
the Ansteds; he came down here that night
you spent here last spring, with papers, you
know, for Mr. Ansted, and you talked with
him a little, and laughed so over his queer
notions. Remember?</p>

<p>"Well, sir, that fellow is simply made
over! It is a great deal more wonderful
than the church! We used to think he
was not more than half-witted. I'll tell you
what it is: I shouldn't wonder if it turned
out that he was double-witted. You didn't
recognize his name to-day, of course; it is
a wonder that he did himself. Hubbard
Myers, that's the boy. Yes, sir, he has
joined the church; and a help he will be
to it, too. Uncle Harold, you ought to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
him pray! He says queer things even in
prayer; at least, they sound queer; but in
spite of yourself you can not help wondering
sometimes whether it is not because he
has gotten ahead of all the rest, and sees
things that they don't understand. I believe
he thinks Miss Benedict is an angel
sent here from heaven to help him. That's
no wonder, though; perhaps she is; anyhow,
she has helped him as well, and perhaps
better than a real angel could have
done; and she is the first one who ever
took any notice of him, or remembered that
he had a soul."</p>

<p>It is no special wonder that the uncle
was deeply interested in this story. It told
more than Harry suspected. How came this
gay young nephew, who had cost him many
sleepless nights, to be sufficiently familiar
with a prayer-meeting to know who prayed,
or how? He studied the bright face before
him most attentively. It was changed, certainly;
he had felt the change in the boy
all day. What was it? How much did it
mean? There had certainly been need for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
change. It made his heart beat fast to think
of Harry's mother, and the possibility of
news for her such as would make her feel
young again.</p>

<p>"Harry," he said gently, "do you know,
I half hope that I have not heard the best
yet of this wonderful story; that there has
been another 'making over.' How is it, my
boy?"</p>

<p>A bright flush mantled Harry's face as
he bent his eyes closer over the paper on
which he was scribbling his own and his
uncle's names with all sorts of flourishes.</p>

<p>Suddenly he raised his head, and looked
full into the kind eyes bent wistfully on
him, and smiled:</p>

<p>"I don't know why I should hesitate to
tell you that, I am sure," he said, speaking
in a firm, manly tone. "It is true enough.
I have been made over, I believe. Certainly
nobody ever needed it more, and nobody
ever struggled harder against it, as you
very well know. At least, you know part;
but I have been lower down than you think,
uncle Harold. Talk about angels! I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
that I don't see how any angel can ever do
more for me than Miss Benedict has done! I've
engaged for life as a servant of the Lord
Jesus Christ. And I owe more to Miss
Benedict, this minute, than I do to any
human being, not excepting even you and
my mother."</p>

<p>The uncle was out of his chair by this
time, one hand on the shoulder of his dear
boy, while he held out the other, which
was promptly grasped; but he could not
speak yet, and he could not see for the
tears. This young fellow was very dear to
him, and the waiting had been long.</p>

<p>"God bless you!" he said at last, his
lips quivering, and unable to utter another
word.</p>

<p>When he could speak again he said:</p>

<p>"My dear boy, have you told your
mother?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Harry, his eyes shining,
"but you can be sure that I am going to.
You see, Uncle Harold, the articles of surrender
were only signed, sealed and delivered,
night before last in the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
night. Since then I have not had a moment's
time that belonged to me; but I'll
write her such a letter as she has never had
from me."</p>

<p>While the uncle walked the parlor of the
boarding-house, and waited for his nephew
to make ready for evening service, he had
some questions to settle which were personal.
He became aware of the fact that
he had certainly jumped to conclusions regarding
some of the workers in the Master's
vineyard which were apparently without
foundation. Here was this Miss Benedict.
He had heard her name mentioned
frequently in the days gone by, and always
as one of the dependences of the church
to which she belonged; and yet he had
always thought of her with curling lip.
"Workers!" he had told himself, being
mentally very sarcastic, "yes, didn't all the
initiated know what that meant when applied to
a fashionable young lady who lived in an
elegant home and mingled with the fashionable
world? It meant that she helped at
the fancy fairs, and festivals, and bazaars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
and what not? Worked them up, probably,
with all their accompanying train of evils.
It meant that she was a district visitor, perhaps,
and left a tract on 'Redeeming the
Time' in a home where they were starving
for lack of employment, and needed a loaf
of bread." He had seen workers of that
sort, and he found it difficult to feel for
them anything but contempt. The thing for
which he was now to take himself to task
was the fact that he had classed Claire
Benedict among these, knowing nothing of
her, meantime, save that she was a member
of a fashionable up-town church; and that,
too, after knowing her father, and singling
him out as a man among thousands. The
simple truth was, that he had imagined a
character of which he disapproved, and named
it Claire Benedict, and then let himself disapprove
of her heartily.</p>

<p>"The sole thing that I know about the
young woman is that she was once wealthy,
and on this account I have judged her as I
have; and I find that it is what I am apt
to do." This is what he told himself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
he walked the length of that little parlor,
and waited. He was much ashamed of himself.
"It is an excellent standpoint from
which to judge character," he said, severely.
"If there is any justice in it I must be a
worthless person myself. I wonder how many
people are setting me down as one who
merely plays at Christian work, because my
father left me one fortune and my old aunt
another!"</p>

<p>I am glad that this man had this severe
talk with himself. He needed it. The
truth is, he was very apt to judge of people
in masses; as though they were specimens,
and belonged to certain types.</p>

<p>The conclusion of his self-examination at
this time was, that he declared that if one
third of what Harry thought about this
young person was true, it had taught him
a lesson. He went to church that evening
apparently for the purpose of studying the
lesson more thoroughly; at least, he gave
some attention to the organist. He had
recognized her in the morning, because she
had eyes like her father; and this evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
he decided that her head was shaped like
his, and that she had the firm mouth and
yet sweet set of lips that had characterized
the father, and he told himself that
he might have known that the daughter
of such a man would be an unusual woman.</p>

<p>After service was concluded, he walked
deliberately forward and claimed acquaintance
with Sydney Benedict's daughter. The glow
that he brought to her face, and the tender
light which shone in her eyes, when he
mentioned that dear father's name, gave him
a glimpse of what the daughter's memories
were.</p>

<p>Harry came up to them eagerly, having
been detained by the pastor for a moment.</p>

<p>"You have introduced yourself, Uncle
Harold, I see. Miss Benedict, I wanted my
Uncle Harold to know you for very special
reasons."</p>

<p>Uncle Harold was unaccountably embarrassed.
What a strange thing for that boy
to say! and what did he propose to say
next? But Claire relieved the embarrassment,
and plunged him into a maze of questioning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
by the sudden, eager interest which flashed
in her face with the mention of his name.</p>

<p>"Are you Harold Chessney?" she asked
as though a new thought came to her with
the union of the two names, "and are you
going to the Rocky Mountains?"</p>

<p>"I am Harold Chessney," he said, smiling,
"and I have in mind a trip to the
Rocky Mountains, if I can make my plans
in that direction what I wish. But why
this should be of interest to you passes my
comprehension." Of course this last he thought.</p>

<p>She did not leave him long in doubt.</p>

<p>"Is Louis Ansted going with you?"</p>

<p>"He is if I can prevail upon him to do
so. That is part of my errand here at this
time, and has to do with the plans I mentioned."
And now his face plainly asked
the question: "Why do <i>you</i> care?"</p>

<p>She seemed to answer the look.</p>

<p>"He needs to go, Mr. Chessney. He needs
help; such help as perhaps you can give
him. I don't know. Something must be
done for him, and that soon. Mr. Chessney,
I <i>hope</i> you will succeed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no time for more. Alice Ansted
came up, and claimed the stranger as
an acquaintance, and stood talking with
him for a moment and expressed extreme
anxiety that he should find her brother in
the city the next day.</p>

<p>"He is somewhere in town, but we never
know where. Still, I could give you a
dozen addresses, at any one of which you
might find him. I hope you will not return
without seeing him."</p>

<p>"I shall not," Mr. Chessney said, decidedly.
"Is he inclined to accompany me,
do you think? Has he mentioned to you
my designs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and would go if it were not for&mdash;Mr.
Chessney, if you could make mamma
understand. No one seems able to. Claire
Benedict has tried and failed; and what she
fails in, perhaps can not be done. I don't
know, but something must be done, and
that speedily."</p>

<p>Almost Claire Benedict's words repeated.
The newcomer walked home in almost silence.
As they neared Harry's door, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is young Ansted about just now?"</p>

<p>"Drinking hard, sir; he is running down
hill very fast. If you don't get him away
with you, I am afraid he will go to the
dogs in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Is he still on terms of special intimacy
with the VanMarters?"</p>

<p>"Well, as to that, I do not know. Things
look mixed. He rails against Willis VanMarter
once in a while, when he has been
taking enough to make him imprudent, and
Miss Alice seems to have broken with them
altogether; at least, Willis does not come
out any more, I think, and Miss Alice is not
in town often; but Mrs. Ansted seems to
be as intimate with them as ever, and Louis
goes there with his mother. I don't know
anything about it, but it looks like a house
divided against itself. If I had such a
mother as Louis Ansted has, I don't believe
I would try to be anybody."</p>

<p>"Mothers don't seem to count for much
sometimes, my boy."</p>

<p>"You mean with their sons, and I dare
say you mean me, Uncle Harold; but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
not true. My mother always counted for
ten times more than you think. It was
she who held me back. If Louis Ansted
had a tenth part of the craving for liquor
that I have, with his mother to push him,
he would have been gone long ago, beyond
reach. I don't know but he is now. He
has been going down very fast in the last
few weeks."</p>

<p>"What is the accelerating cause?"</p>

<p>"That I don't positively know. Partly, it
is the natural result of a bad habit indulged,
I suppose; but there are other influences
at which I can guess. Still, it is
pure guesswork. I am not in any one's
confidence, except when Louis has been
drinking too much, he says to me things
that he would not want me to know if he
were sober, and those, of course, I don't
repeat. I think that his mother is bent on
this union of the two houses, VanMarter's
and theirs, and I think neither Louis nor
Miss Alice are of her mind in the matter;
and I think, moreover, that Louis would
rather have an hour of Miss Benedict's society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
than a lifetime of Miss Eva VanMarter's,
and I don't think he can get what he
wants. Now, isn't that an interesting little
romance for a young fellow like me to
think out, especially when I don't know a
thing about it? The only fact is that Louis
Ansted is in great danger, and nobody seems
to have much influence over him&mdash;at least,
nobody who uses it in the right direction."</p>

<p>"His sister seems to be roused. I was
surprised to hear her speak as she did."</p>

<p>"His sister is not the woman she was
when you saw her last. She has been under
Miss Benedict's influence all winter."</p>

<p>"Evidently you incline to the belief that
Miss Benedict is a remarkable woman,"
his uncle said, with a slight laugh. "Why
has she not been exerting her influence to
help poor Louis?"</p>

<p>"She has tried as hard as a woman can.
But, Uncle Harold, she is not the sort of
woman to promise to marry a man merely
to save him from becoming a drunkard."</p>

<p>"I should hope not," Mr. Chessney answered
promptly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>AN ESCAPED VICTIM.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>IN the quiet of Harry's own room, his
uncle having spent fifteen minutes in
silent and apparently puzzled thought, suddenly
asked a question:</div>

<p>"When did Louis go into town?"</p>

<p>"Several days ago. He has a way of
disappearing suddenly, not giving the family
an idea of where he is going or when he
expects to return, and when he does get
back he shows to any one who is not blind,
that he has been pretty low down."</p>

<p>"They expect him back to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Why, as to that, they have been expecting
him ever since he went away. I heard
Miss Alice say that he went unexpectedly,
leaving word that he should probably be
back to dinner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>"Harry, my boy, I am almost inclined to
think that I ought to start out to-night, and
try to look him up."</p>

<p>"To-night! Why, Uncle Harold, how
could you? It would be midnight and after
before you could reach the city, and then
where would you go? The addresses that
Miss Alice can give you must be respectable
places, with closed doors to-night."</p>

<p>"That is true," Mr. Chessney answered,
after a thoughtful pause; "it would be a
wild kind of proceeding, apparently, with
very little excuse; and yet I am someway
impressed that it is the thing to do."</p>

<p>Alas for the Christian world which believes
in theory, that there is a direct link
between the seen and the unseen, by which the
earnest soul can be told in what way to
walk, and, in practice, thinks it must search
out its own way! Mr. Chessney did not go
out in search of his friend. He did not
even ask his Master whether it was his will
that the apparently "wild proceeding" should
be attempted. He prayed, it is true; and
he prayed for Louis Ansted, but only in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
general way; and he retired to rest, saying
within himself that directly after breakfast
he would go into town and see what he
could do.</p>

<p>Before he was awake the next morning,
the piazza of the little country hotel, where
he stopped, was filled with loungers who
had something unusual and exciting to talk
about. There were a dozen different stories,
it is true; but out of them all the interested
listener could glean certain things
which were painfully likely to be facts.
There had been a runaway&mdash;to that all
parties agreed; and Louis Ansted had been
in the carriage, and had been thrown; but
whether he was killed, or only seriously
hurt, or whether the horse had taken fright
at the approaching train, or whether the
driver had attempted to cross the railroad-track
in the face of the train, or whether
there had been any train at all, authorities
differed. It was still early when Harry
Matthews knocked at his uncle's door with
the confused particles of story.</p>

<p>"And you don't know whether he is living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
or not?" asked the startled uncle who
was now making his toilet with all possible
speed.</p>

<p>"No, I can't find out. Some of them say
he was killed instantly, and others have it
that he was only stunned, and has revived.
It may be nothing but a scare. South
Plains has so little excitement that it is apt
to make as much as it can out of everything.
Uncle Harold, I can't go up there
and find out, for my train will be due in
five minutes, and I must be at the telegraph
office, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes; I will be down in less than five
minutes, and will go immediately up there.
I hope it is chiefly talk." Yet when he was
left alone, he said aloud and mournfully:
"If I had only followed my impressions last
night!"</p>

<p>He had occasion to say it, or, at least, to
think it often, in the days which followed.
South Plains had not exaggerated, this time.
Louis Ansted was not dead&mdash;at least, the
heart was beating; but he lay a bruised, unconscious
heap among the snowy draperies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
of his bed&mdash;his soiled and matted clothing,
which as yet they had not dared remove,
telling to the practiced eye a story of more
than a mere runaway. The skillful doctor,
who had already been summoned from the
city, was silent as well as skillful. He issued
his orders in as few words as possible,
and kept his own counsel, until, left alone
with Mr. Chessney for a moment, in answer
to the question, "What does this stupor
mean?" he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Hard to tell. It was on him before
the accident, if that gives you any light."</p>

<p>It gave him bitter light, and made him
groan in spirit over the fact that he had
been tempted to go out in the night and
hunt for his friend, and had not gone.</p>

<p>Later in the day, bits of the facts came
to him. Louis Ansted had been alone; had
hired a horse at the livery and started for
home. "More under the influence of liquor
than usual, perhaps," the reluctant hostler
at the livery had admitted, "still, I thought
he would get through all right." For the
rest, the silent lips on the bed told no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
tales. He had been found, not very far
from the railroad crossing, lying under a
tree, and the horse had made his way back
to the stables. Whether a train had frightened
the animal, or whether being left to
himself while the driver sank into a drunken
sleep had caused his alarm, or how the accident
had occurred, was left to conjecture.</p>

<p>His mother continually repeated the story&mdash;and
succeeded in making herself believe
it&mdash;that a vicious horse had been given
him, who evidently became unmanageable at
the sound of the locomotive; but some of
the listeners went out and said that there
was no train passing between the hours that
the horse left the stables and returned
there, and the doctor shrugged his shoulders
and said nothing.</p>

<p>Then followed one of those periods of
waiting and watching which some people
know all about; the miseries of which can
only be understood by having to live them.
The trip to the Rocky Mountains was indefinitely
postponed, and Harold Chessney, having
made a journey to the city, and rearranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
his business, returned to take his
place among the watchers.</p>

<p>He was fully roused now; so were all
the friends of the sufferer; his <i>body</i> was
in danger. It was not at all difficult to
make his mother understand this, and no
means were left untried by which the frail
shell might possibly be rescued from impending
ruin.</p>

<p>In this way passed weeks, while the soul
of the injured man hovered on the edge of
another world. Gradually the excitement in
the village calmed down, and everywhere
outside of that house on the hill every-day
life went on again. Mr. Chessney came and
went, keeping a hand on his business interests
where he must, but keeping the most
of his thoughts and the most of his time
waiting, in the hope that consciousness would
return once more to the wreck on the bed.
There was one other who watched and
waited, too, though she could not now go
to the house to inquire. She could pray;
and this she did. Sometimes it seemed to
her that every thought was a prayer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
that periled soul. And often and often she,
too, had to think:</p>

<p>"What if I had been more anxious, and
earnest, and constant, while the body was
comparatively in health&mdash;might not things
possibly have been different?"</p>

<p>It was in the middle of the night, and
Mr. Chessney sat alone with the sick man.
There was nothing to do but wait, and he
had prevailed upon other weary watchers to
rest, and let him take his turn. So there
was only himself to be startled by a low
voice from one who had been for so many
weeks speechless: "Harold, is it you?"</p>

<p>Great was the rejoicing in the troubled
home the next morning. Louis was awake
and conscious, knew them all, smiled feebly
on his mother, and watched hungrily every
movement of Mr. Chessney.</p>

<p>The worst was over; he would gain rapidly
now. So the mother said, with eager
voice and joyful eyes. Alice looked up
questioningly when Mr. Chessney remained
silent and grave, and as soon as opportunity
came, asked her anxious question:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Chessney, I can see that you do not
share mamma's joy. Do you think the indications
unfavorable?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Miss Ansted. I am not
a physician, only a nurse, and I hope I
may be mistaken; but it is true that I am
anxious."</p>

<p>And the doctor, when he came, expressed
no surprise and no pleasure over the change.</p>

<p>"But then he is so utterly unimpressible!"
said the mother, "one might almost as well
have a marble statue for a physician."</p>

<p>Yet the statue worked faithfully and tirelessly,
and, it must be confessed, hopelessly.
To Mr. Chessney he would talk occasionally;
and there came a day when that
gentleman followed him out to the lawn.</p>

<p>"Doctor, what do you think?"</p>

<p>"That it is a charming morning."</p>

<p>"Doctor, is our patient gaining?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is there hope that he will in time?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have no hope of
his recovery?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>"None at all; have not had from the
first. Brains like his never recover from
such treatment as they have received."</p>

<p>"But, doctor, this is very sudden. Do
you mean he will lie there helpless for the
rest of his life?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he will lie there three
weeks longer, but he may; we are not infallible.
I shall have to hasten this morning.
Young Marshall came home in a
drunken rage last night, and kicked his
wife, and she is going to die, I think. I
don't know what we doctors would do if
this were not a free country, and liquor-sellers
had not a right to kill by inches all
the people they choose. This victim over
whom you are watching is only one of
many. That ought to comfort the friends,
ought it not? Good-morning."</p>

<p>"I haven't told them," said Mr. Chessney,
two hours later, speaking to Claire. He had
come out to get a breath of the sweet
morning air, and to give Claire the news.
During the weeks past, he had been very
thoughtful of her anxiety, and very careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
that she should receive daily bulletins. "I
have not told them, but I must. Miss Benedict,
this is the hardest task a man ever
has to do. How can I tell that mother that
she has robbed herself of her son? She
has steadily thwarted for two years every
scheme that I devised to help him; and she
did not know what she was about, either,
poor mother!"</p>

<p>"Did you ever try to tell her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and failed, as you did. Alice told
me of your effort. But I ought to have
tried again. I knew she was deceived. She
thought me a fanatic, and I could have told
her of scenes that would have made one of
her. I shrank from it."</p>

<p>It was more than two weeks before she
saw him again. During this time she twice
received little twisted slips of paper, brought
to her by the faithful Bud, and on them
would be written a request that she would
pray for a soul in peril. One long letter,
blistered with tears, Alice wrote to her;
the burden of it being the same; and this
was all she knew of what was passing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
the house on the hill. She had not entered
it since that day when its mistress turned
from her. Not that she would not quickly
have done so, had occasion arisen, but there
seemed no need to force herself on the
poor mother.</p>

<p>"I shall never see him again," she told
herself, sorrowfully, "and I have seen him
so many times when I might have tried to
help him, and did not!"</p>

<p>Then there came one brief, never-to-be-forgotten
note, written hurriedly by Mr.
Chessney:</p>

<p>"I believe that Louis rests in the Everlasting
Arms."</p>

<p>One Saturday morning she was summoned
to the parlor to see Mr. Chessney. He
came forward quickly, with an anxious air,
as of one having a request to make which
he feared might not be granted.</p>

<p>"I have come for you," he said. "Louis
wants to see you. I have been charged to
bring you back with me, if possible. I wish
I could save you from this ordeal. Do you
shrink from it very much?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," she said with quiet gravity. "Only
as one shrinks from seeing errors that one
is powerless to help. Why am I wanted,
Mr. Chessney? What can I do!"</p>

<p>"I do not know. Louis wants you. He
wishes to see you and his mother and his
sister Alice together, and I shall have to
add that he wants me to be present. I
tried to spare you all this last, but he grew
excited over it."</p>

<p>"I would quite as soon have you present,"
Claire said, with gentle wonder. She
did not understand why it was supposed
to be a time of special trial to her individually.
If she could have heard Mrs. Ansted's
voice in confidential talk with Mr.
Chessney, she would have been enlightened.</p>

<p>"The girl is well enough, Mr. Chessney,
and she has been of help to some of the
lower classes here during the winter. I
have nothing against her; on the contrary,
I would like to shield her. The simple
fact is that she has become too deeply interested
in my son. It is not strange, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
sure, but it is sad; and that is why I do
not wish Alice to have her here at this
time. As a mother, it is my duty to shield
the girl, though I must say she showed
very little consideration for a mother's feelings
when she talked with me." All this,
and much more, which Mr. Chessney weighed,
putting his nephew's views beside them, and
came to the conclusion that there was an
attachment between the two young people
which had not been smiled upon by their
elders.</p>

<p>Although Claire knew nothing of this,
her appearance in the sick-room was attended
with sufficient embarrassment. Mrs.
Ansted received her with a sort of grave
tolerance, as one who was humoring the
whim of a sick man, and doing violence to
her own sense of propriety thereby. But
the change in Louis Ansted was so great,
that, after the first moment, it held Claire's
thoughts, to the exclusion of all trivial
things.</p>

<p>He held toward her a thin and trembling
hand, as he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was good in you to come. I have
changed a great deal since that night you
refused to ride with me, haven't I? Yes,
I have changed since then. Has Harold
told you that I have found help at last?"</p>

<p>"He has told me wonderful and blessed
news of you," Claire said, taking the chair
that Mr. Chessney brought to the bedside.
"I do not need to tell you how glad I was
to hear it."</p>

<p>"No, you don't; that is true. You have
given ample proof that nothing which could
happen to a friend of yours could rejoice
you more. I wish I had met you earlier;
it would have made a difference, a great
difference in my life. I did not know that
religion meant much of anything. Harold,
here, was of your mind, but he seemed exceptional&mdash;a
kind of fanatic; I could not
keep within sight of him. The other people
whom I knew intimately, seemed to have
very little to do with their religion. I beg
your pardon, mother, but that was the way
it seemed to me. There are different degrees,
I suppose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>"Louis, you are talking too much," here
interposed Mr. Chessney, as he brought
the medicine to administer; "your pulse is
rising."</p>

<p>"Never mind, it won't hurt me. It is
almost over now; you know that, Chessney,
as well as I do. And I have something to
say, that for the good of all parties concerned,
must be said now. Mother, I want
you to know one thing: from words which you
let fall yesterday, I have discovered that you
have a mistaken idea about one matter. I
am going to die, and I am glad of it. I
have gone so far down hill, that to climb
back again, for one so awfully bruised as I
am, would be hard, very hard; perhaps the
Lord sees that it would be impossible, and
so gives me this easy way. But, mother,
before I go, I want to tell you something
which will remove from your mind a false
impression. I saw my danger some time ago,
and struggled for a way of escape. It was
a weak way that I chose; God would not
let me build on it. I fancied that if I
could have Claire Benedict for my wife, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
could be a good and true man. I implored
her to help me in this way, and she utterly
and hopelessly refused.</p>

<p>"You know why I am telling you this,
but she does not, and I ask her to forgive
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>THE SUMMER'S STORY.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>AFTER this Louis Ansted steadily
failed. It had seemed as though he
summoned all the strength left in his worn-out
body for that one interview wherein he
had resolved that his mother should know
the truth from his lips.</div>

<p>After that the lamp of life burned lower
and lower. He rallied again, two days
afterward, and was locked in with his lawyer,
and gave critical attention to business.</p>

<p>"I imagine that he made important changes
in his will," Mr. Chessney said to Claire. "I
do not know of what character, though I
was called in as a witness. I hope he
made special provision for his sister Alice.
I think that she is likely to disappoint her
parents in their schemes, and it might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
greatly to her comfort to be independent, so
far as property is concerned. But Louis
kept his own counsel. His lawyer told me
that he might be failing in body, but he
had never seen him clearer in brain. So
there will be no trouble about carrying out
whatever he has planned."</p>

<p>"I did not know," Claire said, "that he
had property to leave, independent of his
parents."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; a large estate, willed to him
from his grandfather, absolutely in his own
right. It is what has helped to ruin him."</p>

<p>"How good it would be if he could make
his money undo, so far as money could,
some of the mischief he has done."</p>

<p>"How could money undo it, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it couldn't. Still, it might relieve
the misery which comes from want. I was
thinking just then of poor little Mrs. Simpson
and her fatherless baby. I have heard
that her husband drank his first glass while
in Louis Ansted's employ, and that Louis
offered it to him, and he did not like to
refuse for fear of giving offense. He died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
with the delirium tremens, and his wife
sold her bedclothes and her shoes to buy
food for him at the last. Perhaps she would
rather starve than take money from poor
Louis. Haven't I heard that he was connected
with one of the distilleries?"</p>

<p>"Some of his property is invested in that
way," Mr. Chessney answered, startled with
the remembrance. "I had not thought of
it. Poor Alice! I am afraid there is great
trouble for her in whatever direction one
looks. If Louis leaves his property to her,
her father and mother will violently oppose
what her intense temperance principles
would advocate. I wish Louis had felt like
talking these things over with me a little."</p>

<p>Well, the day came when they followed
the ruined body to the grave. It rested in
a costly coffin, and the funeral appointments
were such as became large wealth and the
habit of lavish expenditure.</p>

<p>Later, when the will was read, it appeared
that the poor heart had taken counsel
of One who makes no mistakes. He had
done what he could to undo wrong. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
income from valuable investments was large,
and was left in trust to his sister Alice,
to be used at her discretion in relieving
the woes of those who had been brought
low through the influence of intoxicants.
As for the distillery from which half of his
income was derived, its business was immediately
to cease, its stock was to be destroyed,
and its buildings to be made into tenement-houses
for the poor.</p>

<p>"The poor boy was not in his right mind
when he made such a will," the father said.
"Why, it is a sinful waste; it is simply
throwing thousands of dollars into the river."</p>

<p>"It is all the influence of that Benedict
girl," the mother said, in bitterness of spirit.</p>

<p>But the will stood, and its directions were
obeyed with all the promptness that the sister
to whose trust the work was left, could
force her lawyers. She seemed in feverish
haste to have the work of destruction go
on. And when her mother accused her of
being hopelessly under the influence of "that
Benedict girl," and having no mind of her
own, her answer was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma, you are mistaken. At last I
am under the influence of One who has a
right to own me, body and soul. Poor
Louis found Him at last, and yielded to
his power, and followed his direction, and
it was through Claire Benedict's influence
that he did; and, mamma, if he had known
Claire Benedict a few years earlier, we
should have him with us to-day. Mamma,
the time has come for me to speak plainly.
Religion has been nothing but a name to
me until lately. I have not believed in its
power. It is Claire Benedict who has
shown me my mistake, and helped me to
see Christ as a sufficient Saviour. I belong
to him now for time and eternity, and,
mamma, I will never marry a man who
does not with his whole heart own Christ
as his Master, and who is not as intense
and fanatical on the temperance question as
my brother became."</p>

<p>She had always been strong-willed. The
mother had been wont to say, somewhat
boastfully, that her oldest daughter resembled
her in strength of purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>Human nature is a curious study. What
Mrs. Ansted would do, had been a matter
of extreme solicitude to several people. Mr.
Chessney believed that she would make
Alice's life miserable; that she would become
Claire Benedict's enemy, and injure
her if she could, and that she would withdraw
her younger daughters from not only
Claire's, but their eldest sister's influence,
and from the church to which they had become
attached.</p>

<p>"I do not mean that she will do this in
revenge," he said to Claire, "or that she
will really intend to injure anybody. She
is one of those persons who can make herself
believe that she is doing God's service
by just such management as this. I am sorry
for Alice and for the young girls. It gives
me a sense of relief and joy to remember
that Louis is forever safe from pitfalls, and
yet sometimes I can not help wishing that
he could have lived for a few months longer.
He had great influence over his mother.
She tried to manage him, and his indolent
will allowed himself to be influenced in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
wonderful manner, but when he did really
rouse, he had great power over his mother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ansted did none of the things which
were feared. Instead, she turned suddenly,
and with apparent loathing, from the life
which she had heretofore lived. She sent
for Claire one morning, greeted her with a
burst of tears as her dear child, and declared
that had she understood the feeling
between Louis and herself nothing would
have given her greater joy than to have
welcomed her into the family.</p>

<p>Claire opened her mouth to protest and
then closed it again. If this were the form
of cross that she was to bear, it was peculiar,
certainly; but why not bear it as well
as any other? Of what use to explain
again, what the son's own lips had told,
that she had utterly refused the honor offered
her&mdash;that she had never for a moment
desired to be received into this family?
If the bereaved mother had really succeeded
in making herself believe such folly as this,
why not let it pass&mdash;the grave had closed
over the possibility of its ever being realized?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a strange part to play&mdash;to accept
without outward protest the position of one
who would have been a daughter of the house,
to hear herself mentioned as Louis Ansted's
intended wife; to ride, and walk, and talk
with the mother, and help her make believe
that she would not for the world have
thwarted her son's desires; but Claire, after
a few attempts at explanation, dropped the
effort. The mother did not wish to believe
the truth about this, or many other things,
and therefore closed her eyes to them.</p>

<p>She wished also to impress herself and
others with the belief that Louis had been
in every respect an exemplary, and, indeed,
a remarkable young man. She withdrew
her connection with the church in town
and united by letter with the one at South
Plains; avowedly, because "dear Louis was
interested in it more than in any other
church in the world." She imagined plans
that he might have had for the church, and
called them his, and eagerly worked them
out. She adopted the minister, and his wife
and his children, because she had often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
heard Louis say that he would rather hear
that man preach than to hear Doctor Archer;
and once he told her that the minister's
little girl had a very sweet face, and was
a cunning little witch whom he liked to
tease. She turned with something like disgust
from the very name of VanMarter,
protesting that "poor Louis had had a great
deal to bear from their advances," and that
she had no desire to cultivate their acquaintance
further.</p>

<p>On all these strange changes in her
mother Alice looked with bewilderment.</p>

<p>"She frightens me," she said to Claire
one evening, "I don't know what to think.
She contradicts every theory of life I ever
heard her express. She attributes to Louis
graces that he did not possess. She accuses
people of injuring him, who really tried to
help him, and she adopts as plans of his,
things of which I know he had not even
thought. I do not know my mother at all;
and as I said, it frightens me. Is she losing
her mind?"</p>

<p>Claire had no ready reply to these questionings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
for she, too, was puzzled. But Mr.
Chessney, as they walked slowly down from
the house on the hill, discussing once more
the strange change in the woman of the
world, advanced a theory which Claire
adopted, but which was hardly the one to
explain to Alice.</p>

<p>"I think," said Mr. Chessney, "that she
is hushing her conscience. It would like to
speak loudly to her, and tell her that she
is responsible for a ruined life, and she does
not mean to listen to it. She is imagining a
life she believes Louis might have lived,
after the change that came to him on his
sick-bed, and is making herself believe that
he did live it, and that she was, and is,
in hearty accord with it. It is a strange
freak of the bewildering human mind, but
unless I am mistaken, the woman will not
find the peace in it that she is seeking. I
think she will have to cry, 'God be merciful
to me a sinner,' before her heart will
find rest."</p>

<p>And then he added one sentence which
set Claire's heart into a strange flutter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>"Claire, when I see the energy with
which she carries out one of her imaginings,
connected with you, I am very grateful that
Louis insisted on my being present at that
first interview between you and him, and that
I heard the truth from his own lips, for the
mother is succeeding in deceiving every one
else."</p>

<p>"And I do not know how to help it,"
Claire said, with troubled voice. "It seems
a strange thing to be living a falsehood;
but when I try to explain to her, she puts
me gently aside, and acts as though I had
not spoken; and others have no right to
question me about the truth of her theories."</p>

<p>"Except myself. Have I the right? Was
it as emphatic a refusal as poor Louis understood
it? Believe me, I am not asking
merely to gratify idle curiosity."</p>

<p>"There never was anything in it, Mr.
Chessney, and there never could have been."</p>

<p>The passage of all these and many other
events not chronicled here, consumed the
greater portion of the summer vacation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
For Claire Benedict was letting the summer
slip from her without going home. Sore had
been the trial at first; but a few weeks
before the term closed, opportunity had been
offered her to teach a summer class of city
pupils, at prices that were almost equal to
her year's salary. What right had she, who
wanted to bestow so many luxuries on her
mother, to close her eyes to such an opportunity
as this, merely because she was
homesick for a sight of that mother's face?
It had been hard to reconcile the sister, especially,
to this new state of things. The
gentle mother had long ago learned the lesson
that what looked like manifest duty
must not be tampered with, no matter how
hard to bear; but the hot-hearted young
sister refused to see anything in it except
an added trial too great to be borne. Many
letters had to be written before there was
a final reluctant admission that two hundred
dollars more to depend on, paltry sum though
it was, would make a great difference with
the mother's winter comforts. The letter in
which poor Dora admitted this was blistered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
with tears; but the sacrifice was made,
and the extra term had been well entered
upon.</p>

<p>There was much outside of the class and
the life being lived on the hill to occupy
Claire's thoughts. I hope you do not suppose
that the work on the part of "the
girls" had been accomplished during a sort
of "spasm," and that now they were ready to
drop back into inaction. Nothing was farther
from their thoughts. If you have imagined so,
you have not understood how thoroughly
some of them had sacrificed in order to
do. We never forget that for which we
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Besides, the habit of thinking first of the
church, and the various causes which are
the tributaries of the church, was formed.
That the work was to go on, was demonstrated
in many ways; not the least by the
random remarks which came so naturally from
the lips of the workers.</p>

<p>"Girls," had Ruth Jennings said, when
they lingered one evening after prayer-meeting,
"when we cushion these seats, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
shall have to send somebody after the material
who can carry the carpet and wall
paper in his mind's eye. It will never do
to have a false note put in here to jar this
harmony."</p>

<p>"When we cushion the seats!" Claire
heard it, and laughed softly. Who had said
that the seats were ever to be cushioned?
But she knew they would be, and that before
very long.</p>

<p>On another evening, Mary Burton had
said:</p>

<p>"Look here! don't you think our very
next thing, or, at least, one of the next,
ought to be a furnace? I <i>don't</i> like those
stove pipes, if they are Russia. A furnace
would heat more evenly, and with less dust,
and Bud could manage a furnace as well as
he can these stoves."</p>

<p>How naturally they talked about their
future sacrifices! What would have utterly
appalled them a few months before, were
spoken of carelessly now as "next things."</p>

<p>Ruth Jennings readily assented to the necessity
for a furnace, but added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe we shall have Bud for
engineer. He wants to go to school, did
you know it? And what is more, Mrs.
Ansted intends to send him. Fanny told
me about it last night. She says her mother
thinks Louis intended that Bud should
have an education, and she wants to carry
out all his plans. I did not know that
Louis Ansted ever had any such plans, did
you?"</p>

<p>Then Nettie Burdick, after a thoughtful
pause:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, girls, if we can't have Bud for
engineer, perhaps we can have him to
preach for us some day. He told me last
night that if he lived he meant to preach;
and I believe he will, and preach well, too.
Just think of it: Bud a minister!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<small>A FAMILY SECRET.</small></h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>YOU are not to suppose that during
this press of work the moving spirit
in it did not have her homesick hours, when
it seemed to her that she must fly to her
mother, and that at once; that she did not
have her anxious hours, when to provide as
she would like for that dear mother and
that beautiful young sister seemed a dreary
impossibility; that she did not have her discouraged
hours, when new carpet and frescoing
and stained-glass windows seemed only
"vanity of vanities," and the sharp-toned
cabinet organ seemed to wheeze loud enough
to drive all other improvements out of
mind. But there was always this comfort;
she was much too busy to brood long or
often over thoughts like these; and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
thing; weary and disheartened as some rainy
evening might find her, there was forever
an undertone of thanksgiving about Bud and
Harry Matthews, not only, but about others
as well; not excepting several of the girls,
who, though Christians before she knew them,
had stepped upon higher planes of thought
and action&mdash;been vitalized, indeed, in their
Christian life, and would never go back to
the follies of the past. Then came the
trouble in the Ansted home, and the weeks
of waiting and watching, and the final defeat
which was still a triumph. During the solemnities
of those hours, things which had
seemed like trials sank into trivialities, and
life grew to her more earnest and solemn
than ever before.</div>

<p>In all these ways the summer waned.
And now changes of various kinds were
pending. Harry Matthews was about closing
his engagement with the telegraph company,
to enter upon a secretaryship under his
uncle&mdash;a position involving grave responsibilities
and conscientious stewardship. What
joy it was to remember that the new young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
man was equal to the trust. Bud was
to be regularly entered as a pupil at the
Academy, and his face was radiant. The
Ansteds were to stay at South Plains all
winter, and the girls were happy over the
prospect of uniting with the little church
at its coming communion. Mrs. Ansted had
subscribed a hundred dollar addition to the
minister's salary, and told the people that
they ought to feel disgraced for not each
giving doubly the original amount; that her
son Louis, she felt sure, would have taken
the matter up had he lived, and she could
not rest until she saw it accomplished.</p>

<p>Meantime, there was more or less gossip
in the town, of course, about affairs with
which the people, if they had really stopped
to think, had nothing to do. Among other
things, there was wonderment as to why
Harold Chessney came to South Plains so
often. What business was there in this direction
which could require so much attention?
To be sure, he was one of the Directors
of the railroad, but this branch of
it had not heretofore been considered so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
important as to need constant looking after
by its chief. Also there were some who
thought it very strange that that Miss Benedict
would receive so many attentions from
him, when she was as good as Louis Ansted's
widow! Of course that was so, for
Mrs. Ansted herself had as good as said so
dozens of times; and see how intimate she
was with the entire family. Yes, they
knew that Harold Chessney was a very
particular friend of Louis Ansted; but they
should think that would hardly account for
such a degree of intimacy, when Louis had
only been buried a few weeks.</p>

<p>Meantime, the central figures of this
anxious talk went their busy ways, and
seemed in no sense troubled by the tongues.
Harold Chessney came often, and always
visited the Ansteds and the Academy, and
the intimacy between all parties seemed to
increase instead of diminish.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Claire received
an unusually lengthy letter from
Dora; a letter over which she laughed much,
and also shed some tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>Dora had some family perplexities to ask
advice about, and indulged rather more than
was her wont over forebodings in regard to
the coming winter. Then suddenly she
launched into the main channel of her letter
after this fashion:</p>

<p>"Oh, Claire, my dear, you are good! If
I could be half like you, or even one third,
it would be such a relief to mamma as well
as to myself. But Claire (this next that I
am going to say is mean, and small, and
will serve to show you that I have a correct
estimate of myself), I can not help
thinking it would be much easier for me
to be good if I were away off in South
Plains, or North Mountains, or anywhere
else than here, right around the corner from
the old home. Do you have any conception
of what a difference it makes to be around
the corner from things, instead of being on
the same street with them? I think it possible
that I might throw myself intensely
into plans for that North Mountain Church,
you know, if I were there, and forget this
one, and these people, and the old ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>"Claire, part of the time I am pretty
good; I am, indeed; but really and truly,
it is hard. The girls try to be good, too,
some of them. Occasionally I think if they
did not <i>try</i> so hard, I could get along better.
You see, they stop talking about things
when I appear, for fear I will be hurt, and
I am hurt; but it is because they think
I will be foolish enough to care for what
they have been saying. Do you understand
that? It reads as though there were no
sense in it; but I know what I mean. It
is clothes, half of the time. Clothes are
dreadful! I find I had no conception of
their cost. Not that I am having any new
ones. Don't be frightened, dear. I am not
so lost to a sense of what has befallen us
as such a proceeding would indicate. Why,
even a pair of gloves is often beyond my
means! Neither am I complaining. It is
not the gloves; I am quite willing to go
without them. If mamma could have the
things which we used to consider necessities
for her I would be willing to go bare-handed
for the rest of my days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what am I talking about? Let
me see if I can put it into words. The
girls, you know, are always arranging for
this and that entertainment. I meet them
oftener, now that you have insisted on my
going back to the music class. To some of
these entertainments I am invited, and to
more of them I am not. I never go, on
account of clothes and some other things.</p>

<p>"Imagine a party of girls gathered in the
music-room or the hall, in full tide of talk
about what they will wear, and how they
will arrange their hair, and their ribbons,
and all that sort of thing; and imagine a
sudden silence settling over them because I
have appeared in sight, as though I were a
grim fairy before whom it was their misfortune
to have to be forever silent about
everything that was pretty, or cost money!</p>

<p>"Now I am going to make a confession,
and I know it is just as silly as it can be,
but sometimes I can not help rushing home,
and running up to my room, and locking
my door, and crying as though my heart
would break.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am thoughtful, though, about choosing
times and occasions for these outbreaks. I
generally select an afternoon when mamma
is out executing some of your numerous
commissions; but even then I have to
bathe my eyes for half an hour so that the
poor, dear, sweet, patient woman will know
nothing about it. I never do let her know,
Claire. She thinks that I am good and
happy, and occasionally she tells me that
I am growing self-controlled like you, and
then I feel like a hypocrite; but all the
same, for her own good I don't enlighten
her.</p>

<p>"Claire, dear, don't you suppose it is the
silly parties to which I do not go which
trouble me. I have not the slightest desire
to go, and I don't think of them often; I
don't, really. Well, that about having no
desire, needs qualifying. I mean I would
not have, if I could go; I mean I should
like to be perfectly able to go if I chose,
and then to choose to remain at home. Do
you understand?</p>

<p>"If the girls would only be free and social,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
and talk with me as though nothing
had happened, I should learn not to care.
But it is so hard to always feel that people
are saying: 'Hush! there she comes, poor
thing, don't talk about it now, or we
shall hurt her feelings!' I would rather
have them drop me entirely, I believe, as
Estelle Mitchell has done. She doesn't
bow to me any more, even when we meet
face to face; doesn't see me, you know, but
she does even <i>that</i> politely. I don't know
how she manages. Claire, do you remember
the time papa signed that ten thousand dollar
note for her father? Well, never mind.
I am writing a silly and, a wicked letter.
I haven't written so to you before, have I?
I'll tell you what has stirred me so, lately,
everybody is in a flutter about the house.
Claire, it is sold. You know what house I
mean; the dear old one on the avenue,
every separate stone of which speaks of
papa. That Mr. Chessney bought it, who
spends half of his time abroad. There is
a rumor that he is to be married some time&mdash;nobody
seems to know just when&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
bring his bride there to live. It is well for
me that I shall not have a chance to move
in her circle, for I feel almost certain that
I should have to hate her a little.</p>

<p>"It is very absurd, of course, but the
girls are actually beginning already to talk
about the possible reception, though they
don't even know who the prospective bride
is. Some have located her in Chicago, and
some in Europe. I can not discover that
there is an absolute certainty about there
being any bride, and yet some of the young
ladies are planning what would be pretty
and unique to wear.</p>

<p>"Estelle Mitchell is sure of being invited,
because her brother Dick used to be quite
intimately acquainted with one of the Chessney
family; and Dora Benedict is sure of
not being invited, because she is not intimately
acquainted with anybody any more.
I wonder who will have our rooms&mdash;our
dear old rooms? Yes, that largest blot is a
tear. I couldn't help it, and I haven't time
to copy, and could not afford to waste the
paper, if I had. I don't cry very often,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
but I was foolish enough to walk by the
blessed old home this morning, and look up
at the open window in papa's study!</p>

<p>"Oh, Claire, darling, I wish you could
come home, if it is only for a little while,
and we could go away from here. Don't
you think mamma might be made comfortable
in South Plains for the winter?</p>

<p>"Oh, that is foolish, I know; and you
are a dear, brave, self-sacrificing sister, to
give up your vacation and work away all
summer to help support us. To-morrow I
shall not care anything about this, only to
be dreadfully ashamed that I sent you this
wicked letter.</p>

<p>"I am going down now to make tea, and
a bit of cream toast for mother, and I
shall be as bright as a gold eagle, and
hover around her like a moth-miller in the
gaslight, and tell her all sorts of pleasant
nothings, and never a word of the house, or
the sale, or the possible new mistress for
the old home. I am learning, dear, though
from this letter you might not think it.
But I live such a pent-up, every-day life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
that I have to say things to you once in
a while, else what would become of me?"</p>

<p>Claire laughed a great deal over this letter,
pitiful as the undertone in it must have
been to a sympathetic heart. The tears
came once or twice; but after all, the predominant
feeling seemed to be amusement.
It was not answered promptly; in fact, she
waited three days; then came Mr. Chessney
for one of his brief visits, and she read the
letter aloud to him.</p>

<p>What Dora would have thought, could
she have seen that proceeding, passes my
imagination.</p>

<p>What would she have thought of human
sympathy, could she have heard the bursts
of laughter over parts of it; albeit Mr.
Chessney did once or twice brush away a tear!</p>

<p>What would she have thought could she
have heard the conversation which followed:</p>

<p>"Now, my dear Claire, I hope you are
convinced of your hard-heartedness. Poor
Dora ought not to have this strain kept on
her during the autumn, especially when it
is so utterly unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>"The house will be in complete order in
a few weeks' time, and Dora's reception is
just the thing. I can write to Phillips, and
put every arrangement into his hands and
we can appoint Dora manager-in-chief.</p>

<p>"Claire, I have a plan worth a dozen of
yours. Let us have the mother and Dora
here for a visit. They want to see the little
church which they have helped to build.
Nothing could be pleasanter. Then all your
girls, and all your boys, could be present at
the ceremony. Think what that would be
for Bud! He would never forget it. Neither
would this struggling minister; it would
afford an excuse for doing for him just
what we want to do. The law does not
regulate the amount of marriage fees, you
know."</p>

<p>Mr. Chessney was an eloquent pleader;
and Dora's letter, it must be confessed,
plead against the delay that Claire had
thought was wise. Of course, she demurred;
of course, she hinted at the plans that she
had formed for getting ready; but the party
on the opposite side had an answer for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
every argument. He was sure that the way
to do would be to get ready afterward,
when she would have leisure and his invaluable
presence and advice, instead of being
hampered with music-scholars, and he
miles away, alone, waiting, and Dora waiting
and suffering, and the mother thinking
her sad thoughts. Happy surprises were all
very well; they were delightful. He was
entirely in sympathy with her desire to tell
mamma and Dora the story of the new
home in person, only he believed with all
his heart that it would be cruel, and therefore
wrong, to burden that young heart
with the question of ways and means a
moment longer than was necessary. As for
Mrs. Foster, she could supply Claire's place
quietly, and thereby make some poor music-teacher's
heart unexpectedly glad.</p>

<p>Of course, Claire was overruled. She had
really not one sensible reason to offer why
she should remain exiled from mamma and
Dora any longer.</p>

<p>There was a little feeling of pride, it is
true, about the "getting ready afterward;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
but as she looked it over carefully and
prayerfully, it seemed, even to herself, a
mean pride, unworthy of the woman who
was to be Harold Chessney's wife.</p>

<p>Then there was a fascination in the thought
of Dora planning for that reception&mdash;really
being the one to invite whom she would
among "the girls," instead of being the one
left out in the cold.</p>

<p>Also it was pleasant to think what an
event it would be to her girls, and to Bud;
and her cheeks glowed over the thought of
the marriage-fee that would find its way
into the lean pocket-book of the overburdened
minister.</p>

<p>I would like to tell you the whole story
in detail: what Dora said when the letter
came imploring her mother and herself to
come to South Plains for a few weeks'
visit; how the mother demurred on the
ground of expense, and yet confessed that
it made her heart beat wildly to think of getting
her arms around Claire again.</p>

<p>"But I can not think what has become
of the dear child's good sense," she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
add, with a sigh. "Why, Dora dear, she
did not come home, you know, because the
trip would cost so much, and here she is
planning for two of us to take it."</p>

<p>"Never mind, mamma," would Dora reply,
for Dora was desperately determined
on this trip to South Plains, "Claire has
planned a way; and we shall save our food
if we stay two weeks, and that will be
something; and she has sent us the tickets,
so the money is spent. Oh, mamma, let us
go <i>anyway</i>."</p>

<p>And of course they went. Yes, I would
delight to tell you all about it. What a
sensation there was in South Plains, and
how full the little church was, and how
well Bud looked walking down the aisle as
one of the ushers, and how people said the
Ansteds certainly would not come, they
would feel it a family insult, but how the
Ansteds not only came, but took almost entire
charge of everything.</p>

<p>Above all, I should like to have you look
in with me at the parsonage, in the study,
where the minister and his wife stopped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
break the seal of that special envelope after
it was all over; how he rubbed his eyes,
and looked, and looked again, and turned
pale, and said, huskily:</p>

<p>"There is some mistake here, Mary; he
has given me the wrong paper."</p>

<p>And how she came and looked over his
shoulder, and said:</p>

<p>"Why, it has your full name. How can
there be a mistake?" And then she read,
"Pay to Rev. Henry Ramsey, or order, one
thousand dollars. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>Who ever heard of such a marriage-fee
as that!</p>

<p>Oh, now, I have; there have been just
such marriage-fees as that, really and truly.
There had been such before Harold Chessney
and Claire Benedict were married, and
there will be such again. There are poor
ministers and grand, rich men, and there
will be, I presume, while the world stands.
More things than some people dream of are
going on in this world of ours.</p>

<p>There is one thing which it gives me great
pleasure to record. There was a reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
given in the old home. It was after mamma
and Dora had been established for several
days in their old rooms, and it was the evening
after the arrival of the bride and groom,
and Estelle Mitchell was invited to the reception.
Not because her brother Dick had
been intimate with one of the Chessneys, but
because because&mdash;</p>

<p>"My brother Harold gave me liberty to
invite whoever I pleased among my classmates,
and it would give me pleasure to see
you there."</p>

<p>Dora spoke truth. It really gave her
great pleasure to see Estelle Mitchell at the
wedding reception of the Chessneys, and to
realize that she was her guest!</p>

<p>"Oh, you wicked, wicked Dora!" some
of them said, when the excitement caused
by the reception cards was at his height,
"there you heard us talking about the new
furniture, and wondering as to who was the
bride, and you never gave us so much as a
hint!"</p>

<p>Dora laughed, and kept her own counsel.
She did not choose to tell them that during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
those trying days no hint of it had
come to her. That was their pretty family
secret, with which outsiders were not to
intermeddle.</p>

<p>They agreed, every one of them, that
Dora made a charming young hostess, and
Estelle Mitchell said she was glad she was
back in her old home, for she just fitted.</p>

<p>There are but two things which remain
to tell you. One grew out of Ruth Jennings'
farewell words to her beloved music-teacher,
spoken while she was half-laughing,
half-crying, and wholly heart-broken:</p>

<p>"But the organ <i>does</i> squeak horribly;
you know it does; and it is always getting
out of tune."</p>

<p>Mr. Chessney heard it, and during their
wedding-trip he said to his wife:</p>

<p>"There is one thing I want you to help
me select. I have not made my thank-offering
yet to that blessed little church
where I found you. It must have an organ
that will keep in tune, and that will worthily
commemorate the harmony that was begun
there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>Imagine, please, for I shall not attempt
to tell you, the delight, to say nothing of
the unspeakable wonder, of the girls, and
of the entire community, when the beautifully-finished,
exquisitely-toned bit of mechanism
was set up in the church.</p>

<p>Accompanying it were two organ stools,
one for the church and one for Ruth Jennings'
home; so she sits on dictionaries and
Patent Office Reports no more.</p>

<p>The other item can be told more briefly.
It is embodied in a sentence which the
gentle mother spoke one morning at the
breakfast-table:</p>

<p>"By the way, Claire, the committee about
the Mission Band entertainment was here
yesterday while you and Harold were out,
to see if you would help them. I told them
I thought you would."</p>

<p>The face of the bride flushed deeply, and
a peculiarly tender light shone in her eyes
as she said:</p>

<p>"How very strange that is! It is the
same Band which was preparing for that
exercise about which I told you. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
to have had it on the day in which papa
was buried."</p>

<p>"It is the same exercise," Dora said,
speaking gently. "The girls dropped it
entirely, and could never persuade themselves
to take hold of it again, until last
week they voted to attempt it."</p>

<p>"You were only interrupted in your work,
you see," Mr. Chessney said, smiling down
on eyes that were filling with tears. "Interrupted,
that you might set some wheels
in motion that had been clogged; now you
are called back to finish the other, and I
am here to help you."</p>
